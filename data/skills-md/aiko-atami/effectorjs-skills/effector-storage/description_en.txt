Choose and implement effector-storage persistence patterns for Effector apps. Use when tasks involve persist/createPersist usage, selecting adapters (local/session/query/broadcast/storage/asyncStorage/memory/nil/log), configuring clock/pickup/context/keyPrefix, validating data with contracts, handling done/fail/finally flows, SSR-safe adapter fallback with either, or debugging sync and serialization issues.
