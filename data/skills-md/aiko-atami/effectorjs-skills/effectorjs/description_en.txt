Use when tasks involve createStore/createEvent/createEffect modeling, dataflow with sample/attach/split, scope-safe SSR with fork/allSettled/serialize/hydrate, React integration with useUnit, Solid/Vue integration patterns, fixing scope loss, or replacing anti-patterns such as business logic in watch, imperative calls in effects, and direct getState business reads.
