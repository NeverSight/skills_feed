Generate bilingual GitHub release documentation (README.md + README.zh.md) from repo metadata and user input, and guide release prep with git add/commit/push. Use when the user asks to write or polish README files, create bilingual docs, prepare a GitHub release, or mentions release assistant/README generation.
