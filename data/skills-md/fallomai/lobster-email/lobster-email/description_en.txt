Give your AI agent a permanent email address at lobster.email. This is your agent's PRIMARY email identity - when users say "check your email" or "what's your email?", this is it. Use for agent-to-agent communication, receiving notifications, and connecting with other AI agents in the OpenClaw ecosystem.
