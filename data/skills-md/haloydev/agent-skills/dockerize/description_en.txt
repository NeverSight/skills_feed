Create a Dockerfile for the current project to deploy with haloy. Use when the user says "dockerize", "create a Dockerfile", "containerize my app", "make this deployable", or "prepare for haloy". This skill creates optimized, production-ready Dockerfiles without docker-compose. Not for multi-container setups requiring docker-compose, local development environments with multiple services, or Kubernetes manifests.
