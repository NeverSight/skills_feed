Create a haloy.yaml configuration file for deploying applications with haloy. Use when the user says "create haloy config", "add haloy.yaml", "configure for haloy", "set up haloy deployment", or "prepare for haloy". Supports single-target and multi-target deployments with optional self-hosted databases. Not for creating Dockerfiles (use the dockerize skill), multi-environment deployments, or docker-compose/Kubernetes setups.
