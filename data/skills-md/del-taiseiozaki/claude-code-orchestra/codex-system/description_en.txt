Codex CLI handles planning, design, and complex code implementation.
Use for: architecture design, implementation planning, complex algorithms,
debugging (root cause analysis), trade-off evaluation, code review.
External research is NOT Codex's job — use Gemini CLI (Google Search grounding) instead.
Explicit triggers: "plan", "design", "architecture", "think deeper",
"analyze", "debug", "complex", "optimize".
