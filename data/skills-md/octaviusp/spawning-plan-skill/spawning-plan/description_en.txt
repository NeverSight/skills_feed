Spawning Plan. Use when user wants to spawn agents, create a team, or coordinate multiple agents. Automatically gathers context, asks team topology questions, outputs clean TEAM PLAN markdown, and gets user approval. 3 steps: context gathering → questions → present plan. **CRITICAL**: MUST NOT SPAWN AGENTS SKIPPING THIS SKILL, USE ALWAYS.
