description: Form design accessibility rules for user input and data collection
---

## When to Use
Apply when designing input fields, form controls, validation, and user data entry interfaces.

## Rules
- Provide visible labels for all form controls
- Associate labels programmatically with their corresponding inputs
- Group related form fields with clear legends
- Provide clear instructions for required fields and formats
- Display error messages near the related form fields
- Preserve user input when form validation fails
- Provide multiple ways to submit forms
- Ensure form controls are keyboard accessible
- Clearly identify errors in text with specific descriptions
- Provide confirmation for critical actions (legal, financial, data changes)
- Allow users to review and correct information before submission

## Avoid
- Using placeholder text as the only field label
- Hiding labels that are only visible to screen readers
- Ambiguous error messages that don't identify the problem
- Auto-advancing focus that disrupts user control
