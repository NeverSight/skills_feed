Interview the user to turn a proposed product/engineering change into a structured design document. Use when the user asks to be interviewed, wants help clarifying a design, or wants a design doc produced from Q&A. Emphasize numbered questions (few at a time), capture requirements/constraints/UX/data/logic/testing, and output a clean design doc.
