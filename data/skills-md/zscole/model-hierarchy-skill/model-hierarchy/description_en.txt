Cost-optimize AI agent operations by routing tasks to appropriate models based on complexity. Use this skill when: (1) deciding which model to use for a task, (2) spawning sub-agents, (3) considering cost efficiency, (4) the current model feels like overkill for the task. Triggers: "model routing", "cost optimization", "which model", "too expensive", "spawn agent".
