# Mentoring & Education: Evaluators & Reviewers

This directory contains skills for the "Feedback" phase of the teaching lifecycle.

- **Pedagogical Code Grader**: Grades based on "Did they learn the concept?" rather than just "Did it pass tests?".
- **Industry Standard Reviewer**: Gives feedback in the persona of a Senior Engineer.
- **Concept Mastery Validator**: Ensures the teaching plan and the projects are perfectly aligned.

## Use Cases
- **Automated Grading**: Scale your teaching by automating the initial conceptual review of student code.
- **Professional Readiness**: Prepare students for their first job by exposing them to realistic PR feedback loops.
- **Quality Assurance**: Audit your own curriculum to ensure you aren't asking students to do things you haven't taught.
