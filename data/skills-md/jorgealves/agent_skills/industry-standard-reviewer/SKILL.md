# Industry Standard Reviewer

## Purpose and Intent
The `industry-standard-reviewer` helps bridge the gap between "student code" and "professional code." It provides feedback that focuses on the soft and hard skills required to succeed in a professional engineering environment.

## When to Use
- **Final Project Reviews**: Use this to give students a "real-world" experience of what a rigorous code review feels like.
- **Career Preparation**: Helps students learn the professional tone and common "clean code" critiques.

## When NOT to Use
- **Initial Learning**: For absolute beginners, this level of critique might be overwhelming. Use the `pedagogical-code-grader` first.

## Security and Data-Handling Considerations
- Local processing of code snippets; ensures student privacy.
