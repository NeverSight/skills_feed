# Module Class Session Planner

## Purpose and Intent
The `module-class-session-planner` helps mentors and teachers prepare for high-impact live sessions. It ensures that the time is used efficiently and that all key concepts are covered.

## When to Use
- **Session Preparation**: Run this 1-2 days before a class to generate a structured agenda and talking points.
- **Workshop Design**: Useful for planning interactive workshops where timing is critical.

## When NOT to Use
- **On-the-fly Q&A**: This is for pre-planned sessions; it does not replace the mentor's ability to answer spontaneous questions.

## Security and Data-Handling Considerations
- No sensitive data involved; safe for public educational use.
