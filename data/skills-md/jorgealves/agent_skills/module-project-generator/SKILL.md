# Module Project Generator

## Purpose and Intent
The `module-project-generator` creates realistic, challenging projects that force students to apply what they've learned in a "real-world" context.

## When to Use
- **Module Conclusion**: Generate a capstone project at the end of a learning module.
- **Practice Exercises**: Create smaller projects for students who need extra practice in specific areas.

## When NOT to Use
- **Production Boilerplate**: These projects are designed for education; they may lack the enterprise-grade complexity required for production systems.

## Security and Data-Handling Considerations
- Local specification generation; no access to external codebases required.
