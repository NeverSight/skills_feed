# Concept Mastery Validator

## Purpose and Intent
The `concept-mastery-validator` is a quality assurance tool for educators and mentors. It ensures that the learning journey is logically sound and that students are not asked to perform tasks for which they haven't yet received foundational training.

## When to Use
- **Curriculum Auditing**: Run this after designing a new module to ensure the learning objectives match the suggested projects.
- **Project Refinement**: Use this to identify if a project is too difficult or requires "hidden" knowledge not covered in the lessons.

## When NOT to Use
- **Individual Student Grading**: This tool audits the *curriculum structure*, not the student's personal performance.

## Security and Data-Handling Considerations
- Safe structural analysis; does not require sensitive student or proprietary data.
