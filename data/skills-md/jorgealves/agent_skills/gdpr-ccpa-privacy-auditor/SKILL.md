# GDPR/CCPA Privacy Auditor

## Purpose and Intent
The `gdpr-ccpa-privacy-auditor` is a transparency tool. It helps companies ensure that their public-facing privacy policies actually match their technical implementations, preventing "Privacy Washing" and reducing the risk of regulatory fines.

## When to Use
- **Privacy Impact Assessments (PIA)**: Run as part of a recurring privacy review.
- **Marketing Launches**: Check new landing pages to ensure new trackers haven't been added without updating the policy.
- **Due Diligence**: Audit a target company's website during a merger or acquisition.

## When NOT to Use
- **Internal Only Apps**: Not designed for apps behind a firewall or VPN without public endpoints.
- **Comprehensive Legal Audit**: Only focuses on technical indicators (cookies, scripts, data models); does not audit physical security or organizational policies.

## Error Conditions and Edge Cases
- **Server-Side Tracking**: Trackers that run purely on the server (no client-side script) cannot be detected via URL scanning.
- **Dynamic Content**: Some trackers may only load for specific regions or after specific user interactions (like clicking a button).

## Security and Data-Handling Considerations
- **Passive Scanning**: When scanning URLs, it acts like a standard browser.
- **Source Code Privacy**: If providing `source_code_path`, ensure the environment is secure and the code is not transmitted externally.
