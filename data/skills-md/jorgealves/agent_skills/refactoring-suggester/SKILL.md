# Refactoring Suggester

## Purpose and Intent
The `refactoring-suggester` teaches students and engineers how to evolve code. It doesn't just point out problems; it provides a recipe for how to fix them correctly.

## When to Use
- **Code Cleanup**: Use when a codebase has become difficult to manage or "messy."
- **Learning Exercises**: Show students how to transform their working code into "clean" code.

## When NOT to Use
- **Performance Optimization**: This tool focuses on *maintainability*, not necessarily on squeeze-every-cycle performance.

## Security and Data-Handling Considerations
- Operates locally on provided source code.
