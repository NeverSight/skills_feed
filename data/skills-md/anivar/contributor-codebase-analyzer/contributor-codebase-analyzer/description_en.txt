Deep-dive code analysis with periodic saving. Contributor mode reads every commit diff for annual reviews, accuracy rates, and promotion readiness. Codebase mode maps repository structure, cross-repo relationships, and enterprise governance. Works with GitHub (gh) and GitLab (glab). Saves checkpoints incrementally for resume across sessions.
