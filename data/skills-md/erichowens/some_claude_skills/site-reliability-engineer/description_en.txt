Docusaurus build health validation and deployment safety for Claude Skills showcase. Pre-commit MDX validation (Liquid syntax, angle brackets, prop mismatches), pre-build link checking, post-build health reports. Activate on 'build errors', 'commit hooks', 'deployment safety', 'site health', 'MDX validation'. NOT for general DevOps (use deployment-engineer), Kubernetes/cloud infrastructure (use kubernetes-architect), runtime monitoring (use observability-engineer), or non-Docusaurus projects.
