Real-time rope/cable physics using Position-Based Dynamics (PBD), Verlet integration, and constraint solvers. Expert in quaternion math, Gauss-Seidel/Jacobi solvers, and tangling detection. Activate on 'rope simulation', 'PBD', 'Position-Based Dynamics', 'Verlet', 'constraint solver', 'quaternion', 'cable dynamics', 'cloth simulation', 'leash physics'. NOT for fluid dynamics (SPH/MPM), fracture simulation (FEM), offline cinematic physics, molecular dynamics, or general game physics engines (use Unity/Unreal built-ins).
