Expert in temporal event detection, spatio-temporal clustering (ST-DBSCAN), and photo context understanding. Use for detecting photo events, clustering by time/location, shareability prediction, place recognition, event significance scoring, and life event detection. Activate on 'event detection', 'temporal clustering', 'ST-DBSCAN', 'spatio-temporal', 'shareability prediction', 'place recognition', 'life events', 'photo events', 'temporal diversity'. NOT for individual photo aesthetic quality (use photo-composition-critic), color palette analysis (use color-theory-palette-harmony-expert), face recognition implementation (use photo-content-recognition-curation-expert), or basic EXIF timestamp extraction.
