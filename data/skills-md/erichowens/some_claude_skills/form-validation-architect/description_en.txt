End-to-end form handling with react-hook-form, Zod schemas, validation patterns, error messaging, field arrays, and multi-step wizards. Use for complex forms, validation architecture, autosave, field dependencies. Activate on "form validation", "react-hook-form", "Zod", "form error", "multi-step form", "wizard". NOT for simple HTML forms, backend validation only, or non-React frameworks.
