Progressive Web App development with Service Workers, offline support, and app-like behavior. Use for caching strategies, install prompts, push notifications, background sync. Activate on "PWA", "Service Worker", "offline", "install prompt", "beforeinstallprompt", "manifest.json", "workbox", "cache-first". NOT for native app development (use React Native), general web performance (use performance docs), or server-side rendering.
