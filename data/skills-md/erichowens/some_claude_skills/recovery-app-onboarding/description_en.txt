Expert guidance for designing and implementing onboarding flows in recovery, wellness, and mental health applications. This skill should be used when building onboarding experiences, first-time user flows, feature discovery, or tutorial systems for apps serving vulnerable populations (addiction recovery, mental health, wellness). Activate on "onboarding", "first-time user", "tutorial", "feature tour", "welcome flow", "new user experience", "app introduction", "recovery app UX". NOT for general mobile UX (use mobile-ux-optimizer), marketing landing pages (use web-design-expert), or native app development (use iOS/Android skills).
