Test-Driven Development workflow specialist using RED-GREEN-REFACTOR cycle for test-first software development. Use when developing new features from scratch, creating isolated modules, or when behavior specification drives implementation. Do NOT use for refactoring existing code (use moai-workflow-ddd instead) or when behavior preservation is the primary goal.
