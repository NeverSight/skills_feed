Guide for using SLIME (LLM post-training framework for RL Scaling). Use when working with SLIME for reinforcement learning training of language models, including setup, configuration, training execution, multi-turn interactions, custom reward models, tool calling scenarios, or troubleshooting SLIME workflows. Covers GRPO, GSPO, PPO, Reinforce++, multi-agent RL, VLM training, FSDP/Megatron backends, SGLang integration, dynamic sampling, and custom generation functions.
