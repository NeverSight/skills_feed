Set up formatting, linting, import sorting, type checking, and pre-commit hooks when scaffolding or starting a new project. Use this skill whenever creating a new project, initializing a repo, scaffolding an app, or when the user asks to add linting/formatting to an existing project. Triggers on: "new project", "scaffold", "init", "set up linting", "add formatter", "add pre-commit hooks", "configure biome", "configure ruff". The goal is to establish code quality tooling from day one so issues are caught incrementally, not in a painful bulk-fix later.
