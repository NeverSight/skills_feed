Operating protocol that uses Taskwarrior as the continuity layer across conversations. Grounds every interaction in real task state before acting. Activate on "morning" / "briefing" for daily overview, on "status" / "what's next" for current state, when capturing tasks ("remind me to", "add task", "I need to"), when recovering from stalls, or when executing structured work across projects, repos, and life domains.
