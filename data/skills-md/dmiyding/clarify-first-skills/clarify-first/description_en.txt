Use this skill when a request is ambiguous/underspecified, contains conflicts, or has high-impact consequences. The agent must do a quick risk triage (low/medium/high). For low-risk work, proceed with explicit assumptions and reversible steps. For medium/high-risk or conflicting requirements, pause execution, summarize context, list uncertainties, ask targeted clarification questions (with choices), and get confirmation before irreversible actions (writing files, running commands, deleting data, deploying, messaging, spending money). If a better solution exists, propose it and ask the user to choose.
