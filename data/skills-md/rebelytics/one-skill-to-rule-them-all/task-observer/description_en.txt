Monitors task execution for skill improvement opportunities. Use this skill during ANY multi-step task, agentic workflow, or substantive work session where Claude is using tools and producing deliverables. It captures patterns, user corrections, workflow insights, and methodology worth preserving as reusable skills. Also triggers during post-task feedback discussions and when the user explicitly mentions skill observations, improvements, the observation log, skill taxonomy, or asks Claude to watch for skill opportunities. Also known as "One Skill to Rule Them All" — trigger on this phrase too. IMPORTANT: this skill should be invoked at the start of every task-oriented session — if you are about to use tools to produce deliverables, invoke this skill first.
