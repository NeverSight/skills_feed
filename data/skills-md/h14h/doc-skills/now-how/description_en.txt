Generate, update, or consult a project's HOW.md and domain specs — the architecture map and domain-specific documentation that tells collaborators how the codebase is organized and what they need to know beyond what the code itself shows. Use when the user wants to document the codebase architecture, create or update domain specs, write a HOW.md, map the codebase, keep documentation in sync with code changes, or when you need to understand a project's architecture before answering questions or doing work. Triggers include "now how", "document the architecture", "write specs", "update the docs", "map the codebase", "update the spec for [domain]", "create docs", "how does [X] work in this project", "check the docs first", or "use now-how".
