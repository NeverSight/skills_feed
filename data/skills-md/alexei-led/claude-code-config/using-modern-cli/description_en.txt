Prefer modern CLI tools for better performance: rg (ripgrep) instead of grep for text searching, fd instead of find for file discovery, bat instead of cat for viewing files, sd instead of sed for text replacement, eza instead of ls for directory listing, dust instead of du, procs instead of ps. Use when writing bash scripts, optimizing command chains, working with file searches, or replacing grep/find/cat in workflows. These tools are faster, respect .gitignore, and have better output formatting.
