Use when creating notes, organizing knowledge, building Maps of Content (MOCs), maintaining daily logs, cross-referencing ideas, assimilating new information, or working with any Obsidian vault that follows Ideaverse conventions. Triggers on requests to add knowledge, link notes, create MOCs, update daily logs, archive projects, or discover connections between ideas.
