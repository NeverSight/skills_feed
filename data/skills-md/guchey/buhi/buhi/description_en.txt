Audible notifications for Claude Code tasks and user confirmations. Use this skill when the user wants to (1) test the notification sound by running /buhi, (2) hear the notification sound manually, or (3) get help with configuring automatic sound playback on task completion and user confirmation requests using Claude Code's hook system (Stop hook and PreToolUse hook with AskUserQuestion matcher). The skill automatically detects whether it's installed globally or locally and configures the appropriate settings.json file with absolute paths.
