Design and build agent-first CLIs with HATEOAS JSON responses, context-protecting output, and self-documenting command trees. Use when creating new CLI tools, adding commands to existing CLIs (joelclaw, slog, igs), or reviewing CLI design for agent-friendliness. Triggers on 'build a CLI', 'add a command', 'CLI design', 'agent-friendly output', or any task involving command-line tool creation.
