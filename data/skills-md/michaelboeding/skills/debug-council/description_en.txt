Research-aligned self-consistency for debugging. Spawns independent solver agents that each explore and debug the problem from scratch. Uses majority voting. Based on "Self-Consistency Improves Chain of Thought Reasoning" (Wang et al., 2022). Use for critical bugs, algorithms, or when other approaches have failed.
