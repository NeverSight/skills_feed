Analyze a codebase to extract its conventions, patterns, and style. Spawns specialized analyzer agents that each focus on one aspect (structure, naming, patterns, testing, frontend). Generates a comprehensive style guide that other skills can reference. Use when starting work on an unfamiliar codebase, or to create explicit documentation of implicit conventions.
