Use React/React Native code as the source of truth and implement the equivalent feature in iOS/Swift. Understands the feature behavior, components, state management, and logic from React, then creates idiomatic iOS code that matches the target codebase's existing patterns. Use when porting features from React/React Native to native iOS or building native alternatives to web components.
