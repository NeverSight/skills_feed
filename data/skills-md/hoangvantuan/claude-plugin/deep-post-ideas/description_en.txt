Extract compelling post outlines from reference materials (newsletters, scripts, notes, journal entries) and transform them into structured outlines for engaging, wisdom-style social media posts. Use when the user provides reference material and wants post ideas, content outlines, or building blocks for social media content. Triggers on "extract post ideas from...", "post outlines from this...", "turn this into post ideas", "content ideas from...", or "deep post ideas".
