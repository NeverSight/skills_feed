# Viral Post Creator

Create profound, shareable social media content using three proven archetypes and psychological engagement patterns.

## Workflow

### Phase 1: Context Gathering Interview

Begin with: "Let's explore the philosophical territory you want to address. I'll ask you 5-7 focused questions to understand your unique perspective and audience."

Ask one at a time:

1. **Domain & Expertise**: "What area of life or work do you want to address?"
2. **Audience Pain Point**: "What specific struggle or paradox does your audience face? What keeps them up at night?"
3. **Your Unique Observation**: "What pattern or truth have you noticed that others might be missing?"
4. **Transformation Vision**: "If your post could shift one belief or behavior, what would it be?"
5. **Personal Connection**: "What personal experience gives you credibility to speak on this?"
6. *(Optional)* **Examples/Metaphors**: "What specific metaphors from your domain would resonate?"
7. *(If needed)* **Tone**: "Validating their struggle, pushing for radical change, or making them question everything?"

After gathering, summarize and proceed to generation.

### Phase 2: Post Generation

Generate exactly **9 posts** — 3 variations of each archetype.

#### The Patient Observer (3 variations, 150-200 words each)

- Validate struggle before offering hope
- Use time escalation: days -> weeks -> months -> years
- End with breakthrough that "hits all at once"
- Create subtle in-group/out-group dynamics

#### The Dramatic Prophet (3 variations, 100-150 words each)

- Command transformation through extreme metaphors
- Use intensity escalation and mythological language
- Include "burn it down" or "reset" imagery
- Promise transcendence through destruction

#### The Quiet Devastator (3 variations, 50-100 words each)

- Make simple observations that imply worldview critiques
- Use ironic comparisons or parallel structures
- End with "I think about this often" or similar haunting reflection
- No prescriptions, just observations

### Post Structure Requirements

Every post must follow this arc:

1. **Hook**: Question / Declaration / Observation
2. **Tension**: The struggle / problem / irony
3. **Escalation**: Time / intensity / comparison build
4. **Turn**: "Then" / "But" / "Only a few" pivot
5. **Resolution**: Breakthrough / transformation / reflection

### Power Techniques

Apply across all posts:

- **"You"** for immediate involvement
- **Strategic vagueness** — let readers project their own situation
- **One memorable phrase** per post
- **White space** and short paragraphs for impact
- **Leave something crucial unsaid**

### Phase 3: Recommend Best Performer

After all 9 posts, select the one most likely to resonate with the stated audience and explain why in 2-3 sentences.

## Constraints

- Never use citations or appeals to authority
- Avoid explaining — describe and let readers conclude
- No emoji or hashtags in post text
- Maintain philosophical depth in plain language
- Each variation must feel distinct
- Inspire without manipulating
