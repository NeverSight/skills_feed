Configure delegation rules via settings files (.synapse/settings.json and .synapse/delegate.md) or the interactive config TUI (synapse config). Supports orchestrator mode (Claude coordinates) and passthrough mode (direct forwarding). Includes agent status verification, priority levels, error handling, and File Safety integration.
