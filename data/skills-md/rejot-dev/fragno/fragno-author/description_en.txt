Create or modify Fragno fragments (library-author workflow): scaffold a fragment package, define fragment config/schema, add dependencies/services, declare routes, build server instantiation, and export client builders plus per-framework client entrypoints. Use when asked to build a new fragment, add routes/hooks, or set up fragment packaging/code-splitting for authors.
