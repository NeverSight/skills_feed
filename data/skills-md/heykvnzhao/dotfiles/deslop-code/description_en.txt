Clean up AI-generated code changes by reviewing diffs against main and removing stylistic or structural artifacts (over-commenting, unnecessary defensive checks, try/catch noise, any-casts, inconsistent style). Use when asked to “remove AI code slop,” “humanize” changes, or align a branch’s edits with existing codebase conventions.
