This skill should be used when managing objectives - coherent goals that require 2+ plans/PRs to complete. Use when users want to create multi-plan tracking issues, log progress across related PRs, capture lessons learned, or coordinate work that spans multiple erk-plans. Objectives are human-first coordination documents, not executable plans.
