This skill should be used when inspecting, analyzing, or querying Claude Code session logs. Use when users ask about session history, want to find sessions, analyze context usage, extract tool call patterns, debug agent execution, or understand what happened in previous sessions. Essential for understanding Claude Code's ~/.claude/projects/ structure, JSONL session format, and the erk extraction pipeline.
