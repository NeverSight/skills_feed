General-purpose X/Twitter research agent. Searches X for real-time perspectives, dev discussions, product feedback, cultural takes, breaking news, and expert opinions. Works like a web research agent but uses X as the source. Use when: (1) user says "x research", "search x for", "search twitter for", "what are people saying about", "what's twitter saying", "check x for", "x search", "/x-research", (2) user is working on something where recent X discourse would provide useful context (new library releases, API changes, product launches, cultural events, industry drama), (3) user wants to find what devs/experts/community thinks about a topic. NOT for: posting tweets, account management, or historical archive searches beyond 7 days.
