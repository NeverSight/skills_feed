This skill generates interactive mathematical function plots using Plotly.js for iframe embedding in intelligent textbooks. Creates visualizations with hover tooltips, interactive sliders to move points along curves, responsive design optimized for narrow layouts, and comprehensive educational documentation. Use this when users request plotting mathematical functions, graphing equations, visualizing f(x), or creating interactive function explorers for calculus, precalculus, physics, or engineering courses.
