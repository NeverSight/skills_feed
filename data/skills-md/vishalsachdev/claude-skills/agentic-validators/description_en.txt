Design and install validation hooks for coding agents (e.g., Claude Code) to make AI changes safer and more deterministic. Use when you want post-tool-use or stop hooks, automated tests/linters/formatters, parallel subagents with per-file validation, or a repeatable “agent pipeline” with audit logs.
