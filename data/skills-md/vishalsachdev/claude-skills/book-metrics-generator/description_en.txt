This skill generates comprehensive metrics reports for intelligent textbooks built with MkDocs Material, analyzing chapters, concepts, glossary terms, FAQs, quiz questions, diagrams, equations, MicroSims, word counts, and links. Use this skill when working with an intelligent textbook project that needs quantitative analysis of its content, typically after significant content development or for project status reporting. The skill creates two markdown files - book-metrics.md with overall statistics and chapter-metrics.md with per-chapter breakdowns - in the docs/learning-graph/ directory.
