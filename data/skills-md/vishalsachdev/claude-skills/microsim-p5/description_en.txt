Create an interactive educational MicroSim using the p5.js JavaScript library with distinct regions for drawing and interactive controls.  Each MicroSim is a directory located in the /docs/sims folder.  It has a main.html file that references the javascript code and the main.html can be referenced as an iframe from the index.md.  The metadata.json contains Dublin core metadata about the MicroSim.
