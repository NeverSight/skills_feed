This skill generates interactive Chart.js bubble chart visualizations for priority matrices and multi-dimensional data analysis. Use this skill when users need to create scatter plots with variable bubble sizes, particularly for 2x2 priority matrices (Impact vs Effort, Risk vs Value, etc.), portfolio analysis, or any visualization comparing items across two dimensions with a third dimension represented by size. The skill creates a complete MicroSim package with HTML, CSS, and documentation.
