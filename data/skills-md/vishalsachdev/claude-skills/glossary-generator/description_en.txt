This skill automatically generates a comprehensive glossary of terms from a learning graph's concept list, ensuring each definition follows ISO 11179 metadata registry standards (precise, concise, distinct, non-circular, and free of business rules). Use this skill when creating a glossary for an intelligent textbook after the learning graph concept list has been finalized.
