Extracts lessons learned from conversations and persists them to AI assistant config files (CLAUDE.md, GEMINI.md, AGENTS.md, Cursor, Copilot, Windsurf, Continue). Use when: debugging revealed issues, commands failed then succeeded, assumptions proved wrong, workarounds were discovered, undocumented behavior found, or user says "remember this".
