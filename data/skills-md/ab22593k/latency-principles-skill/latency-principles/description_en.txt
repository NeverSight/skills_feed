Principles, laws, and checklists for analyzing and optimizing software latency. Use this skill when: (1) Diagnosing slow performance or latency spikes, (2) Designing systems with strict latency requirements, (3) Analyzing theoretical limits using Little's Law or Amdahl's Law, or (4) Learning about latency sources (OS, Hardware, Network).
