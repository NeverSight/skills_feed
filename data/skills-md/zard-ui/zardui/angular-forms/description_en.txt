Build signal-based forms in Angular v21+ using the new Signal Forms API. Use for form creation with automatic two-way binding, schema-based validation, field state management, and dynamic forms. Triggers on form implementation, adding validation, creating multi-step forms, or building forms with conditional fields. Signal Forms are experimental but recommended for new Angular projects.
