Master enterprise-grade TypeScript development with type-safe patterns, modern tooling, and framework integration. This skill provides comprehensive guidance for TypeScript 5.9+, covering type system fundamentals (generics, mapped types, conditional types, satisfies operator), enterprise patterns (error handling, validation with Zod), React integration for type-safe frontends, NestJS for scalable APIs, and LangChain.js for AI applications. Use when building type-safe applications, migrating JavaScript codebases, configuring modern toolchains (Vite 7, pnpm, ESLint, Vitest), implementing advanced type patterns, or comparing TypeScript with Java/Python approaches.
