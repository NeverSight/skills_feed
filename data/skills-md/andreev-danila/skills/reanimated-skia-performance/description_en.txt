Write and review high-performance React Native animations and 2D graphics using react-native-reanimated (v4+) and @shopify/react-native-skia (Canvas scenes, runtime effects/shaders). Use for: gesture-driven interactions, spring/timing transitions, layout/mount animations, Reanimated CSS transitions/animations, Skia drawings, animated shader uniforms, path/vector interpolation, dev-mode tuning panels (sliders), and diagnosing animation jank (JS thread stalls, excessive re-renders, per-frame allocations).
