Automates Notion workspaces via the official Notion REST API and SDKs: authenticate an integration, search for pages/databases, query data sources, create/update pages and blocks, move pages, apply templates, and handle pagination + rate limits. Use when the user mentions the Notion API, Notion integrations, Notion databases/data sources, syncing content with Notion, or making HTTP requests to api.notion.com.
