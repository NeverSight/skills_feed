Builds performant animations and gesture-driven interactions in React Native (Expo) apps using React Native Reanimated v4 and React Native Gesture Handler (GestureDetector / hook API). Use when implementing UI motion, transitions, layout/entering/exiting animations, CSS-style transitions/animations, interactive gestures (pan/pinch/swipe/drag), scroll-linked animations, worklets/shared values, or debugging animation performance and threading issues.
