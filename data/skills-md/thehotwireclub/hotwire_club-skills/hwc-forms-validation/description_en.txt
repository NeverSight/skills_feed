Handle Hotwire form workflows: form submission lifecycle, inline editing, validation errors, typeahead/autocomplete, modal forms, and external form controls. Prefer this skill when the core problem is correctness and UX of form interaction. Use hwc-navigation-content for pagination/tabs/filter navigation, hwc-realtime-streaming for WebSocket/Turbo Stream broadcasting, hwc-media-content for image/video/audio behavior, hwc-ux-feedback for generic loading/transition polish, and hwc-stimulus-fundamentals for framework-level Stimulus APIs not tied to forms.
