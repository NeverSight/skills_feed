Implement real-time Hotwire behavior: Turbo Streams over WebSocket/SSE, custom stream actions, inline stream tags, live list updates, and cross-tab state synchronization. Prefer this skill when the core problem is push-based updates or stream action orchestration. Use hwc-navigation-content for pull-based pagination/tab/lazy-navigation flows, hwc-forms-validation for form lifecycle and validation, hwc-media-content for media upload/playback behavior, hwc-ux-feedback for generic loading/progress/transitions, and hwc-stimulus-fundamentals for non-stream Stimulus fundamentals.
