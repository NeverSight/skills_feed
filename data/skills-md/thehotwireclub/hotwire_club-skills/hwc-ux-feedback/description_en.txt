Implement cross-cutting Hotwire UX feedback patterns: loading states, busy indicators, progress bars, optimistic UI, render interception, and view/page transitions. Prefer this skill when the core goal is perceived performance and user feedback, independent of a single feature domain. Use hwc-forms-validation for form correctness and validation behavior, hwc-navigation-content for navigation/history/cache mechanics, hwc-realtime-streaming for push/stream orchestration, hwc-media-content for media-specific behavior, and hwc-stimulus-fundamentals for base Stimulus API questions.
