Handle media-heavy Hotwire features: image/video/audio uploads, previews, playback controls, progress tracking, and third-party media integrations (for example WaveSurfer, Swiper, Picture-in-Picture, Blurhash). Prefer this skill when the core problem is media rendering, playback state, or media library integration. Use hwc-realtime-streaming for server-pushed Turbo Stream updates, hwc-navigation-content for non-media pagination/tab/lazy-navigation flows, hwc-forms-validation for form validation and inline-edit behavior, hwc-ux-feedback for generic loading/transition patterns, and hwc-stimulus-fundamentals for Stimulus primitives not specific to media.
