Generate Go services following GO modular architechture conventions (Fx DI, OTEL tracing, interface-first design). Use when creating reusable business services in internal/modules/<module>/service/ - email senders, token generators, hashing utilities, template compilers, cache-backed lookups, or any domain service that encapsulates a single responsibility and is consumed by use cases or other services.
