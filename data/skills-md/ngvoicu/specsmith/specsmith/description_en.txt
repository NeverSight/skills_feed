Structured spec management for AI coding workflows. Converts ephemeral plans into persistent, resumable specs with phases, tasks, and progress tracking that survive across sessions. Use this skill whenever the user: exits plan mode (automatically offer to save the plan as a spec), says "resume" or "what was I working on", wants to switch between projects, mentions specs/phases/tasks, says "spec new/list/resume/status/pause/activate", says "forge", "research", "create a spec for X", "plan X", says "generate openapi", "update api spec", "create api docs", "openapi", or any workflow involving structured planning that should persist. Also trigger when the user starts a new session in a project that has a `.specs/` directory — check for an active spec and offer to resume.
