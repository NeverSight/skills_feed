Run quick, ad-hoc validation or test checks using Bun by writing a temporary TypeScript script in the repo that imports local code, iterating on the script and rerunning until validated (including confirming a failure), then deleting the script. Use when immediate validation is needed to confirm assumptions, inspect remote state, or prototype small checks without adding permanent files or tests.
