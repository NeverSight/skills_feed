Distinguishes strategic vs tactical work during development using Shreyas Doshi's frameworks and Marty Cagan's empowered teams principles. Use when making architectural decisions, choosing what to build, preventing "product theater", or applying the LNO framework (Leverage, Neutral, Overhead). Helps avoid feature factory and build work that compounds.
