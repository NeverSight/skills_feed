Guide and tooling for Ralph Driven Development (RDD), a spec runner that repeatedly invokes Codex (or other agents) over ordered specs until a magic phrase signals completion. Use when setting up or operating an RDD workflow with plan.md, specs/, done.md, agent-run.log, and a ralph.py runner, or when customizing the runner CLI and prompt contract.
