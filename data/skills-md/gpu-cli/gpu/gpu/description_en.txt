GPU CLI assistant - run NVIDIA GPU workloads from your Mac. Use when users:
- Want to run ML/AI on cloud GPUs ("train a model", "run inference", "generate images")
- Need help creating GPU projects (ComfyUI, vLLM, training, inference)
- Have GPU CLI errors (OOM, sync, connection, model loading issues)
- Want to optimize GPU costs or choose the right GPU
- Need help with gpu.jsonc configuration
- Ask about GPU CLI commands (gpu run, gpu use, gpu status, etc.)
