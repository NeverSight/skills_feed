Use this skill when working with Terragrunt infrastructure configurations. Triggers include:
- Setting up a new Terragrunt infrastructure catalog from scratch
- Creating or managing Terragrunt stacks (terragrunt.stack.hcl)
- Creating units that wrap OpenTofu modules from separate repos
- Configuring live infrastructure repositories with root.hcl hierarchy
- Setting up remote state backends (S3 with DynamoDB locking)
- Multi-account/multi-environment deployments with cross-account role assumption
