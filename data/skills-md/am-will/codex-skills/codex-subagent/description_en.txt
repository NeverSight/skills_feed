Spawn Codex subagents via background shell to offload context-heavy work. Use for: deep research (3+ searches), codebase exploration (8+ files), multi-step workflows, exploratory tasks, long-running operations, documentation generation, or any other task where the intermediate steps will use large numbers of tokens.
