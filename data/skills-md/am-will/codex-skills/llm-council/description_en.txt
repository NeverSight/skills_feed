Orchestrate a configurable, multi-member CLI planning council (Codex, Claude Code, Gemini, OpenCode, or custom) to produce independent implementation plans, anonymize and randomize them, then judge and merge into one final plan. Use when you need a robust, bias-resistant planning workflow, structured JSON outputs, retries, and failure handling across multiple CLI agents.
