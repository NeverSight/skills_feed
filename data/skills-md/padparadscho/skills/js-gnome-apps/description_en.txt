Build native GNOME desktop applications using JavaScript (GJS) with GTK 4, Libadwaita, and the GNOME platform. Use when the user wants to create, modify, or debug a GNOME app written in JavaScript/GJS, including UI design with XML or Blueprint, GObject subclassing, Meson build setup, Flatpak packaging, or any task involving GJS bindings for GLib/GIO/GTK4/Adw libraries. Also use when working with `.ui` files, `meson.build`, GResource XML, GSettings schemas, `.desktop` files, or Flatpak manifests in a GJS project context.
