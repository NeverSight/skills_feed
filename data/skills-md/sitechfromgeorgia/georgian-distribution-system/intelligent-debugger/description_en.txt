Comprehensive systematic debugging agent for hunting down complex bugs, root causes, and error propagation across full stack (frontend, backend, APIs, databases). Use when diagnosing errors, troubleshooting issues, analyzing stack traces, investigating bugs, examining logs, debugging performance problems, or tracking down error causes. Also use when users mention debugging, errors, bugs, failures, crashes, exceptions, or unexpected behavior.
