Diagnose and audit SEO issues affecting crawlability, indexation, rankings, and organic performance. Use when the user asks for an SEO audit, technical SEO review, ranking diagnosis, on-page SEO review, meta tag audit, or SEO health check. This skill identifies issues and prioritizes actions but does not execute changes. For large-scale page creation, use programmatic-seo. For structured data, use schema-markup.
