This skill should be used when users want to run any workload on Hugging Face Jobs infrastructure. Covers UV scripts, Docker-based jobs, hardware selection, cost estimation, authentication with tokens, secrets management, timeout configuration, and result persistence. Designed for general-purpose compute workloads including data processing, inference, experiments, batch jobs, and any Python-based tasks. Should be invoked for tasks involving cloud compute, GPU workloads, or when users mention running jobs on Hugging Face infrastructure without local setup.
