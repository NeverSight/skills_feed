Circle high above the issue board, spotting what's dead (implemented but not closed), what's decaying (stale/outdated), and what needs consolidation. The vulture descends, cleans up the carcass, and leaves the backlog healthy. Use when your issue board needs hygiene—closing completed work, consolidating fragments, and removing decay.
