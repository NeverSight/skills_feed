The keeper of the animal ecosystem. Not an animal themselves, but the one who understands the forest deeply enough to invite new creatures in. The druid communes with existing animals, walks through the grove to find the right name, and performs the ritual of creation. Use when creating new animal skills or gatherings for the Grove ecosystem.
