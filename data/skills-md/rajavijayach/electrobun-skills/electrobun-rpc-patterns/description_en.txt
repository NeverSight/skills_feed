Advanced type-safe RPC patterns for Electrobun desktop applications. Covers bidirectional main↔webview communication, type safety with TypeScript, error handling and validation, performance optimization, streaming data patterns, batch operations, retry strategies, event-based communication, shared type definitions, RPC middleware, request/response patterns, and complex data synchronization. Use this skill when implementing complex communication between main and webview processes, need type-safe RPC with full IntelliSense, handling large data transfers, implementing real-time updates, building type-safe APIs between processes, debugging RPC issues, optimizing RPC performance, or implementing advanced patterns like streaming, batching, or pub/sub. Triggers include "RPC", "main webview communication", "type-safe RPC", "bidirectional RPC", "RPC performance", "RPC error handling", "shared types", "process communication", or "IPC patterns".
