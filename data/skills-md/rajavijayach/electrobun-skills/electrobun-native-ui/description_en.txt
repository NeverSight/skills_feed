Native UI integration for Electrobun desktop applications including ApplicationMenu, ContextMenu, system Tray, native dialogs, keyboard shortcuts, and platform-specific UI patterns. This skill covers creating application menus with submenus and accelerators, context menus triggered by right-click, system tray icons with menus, file/folder dialogs, message boxes, notification systems, global keyboard shortcuts, menu item roles, dynamic menu updates, platform-specific menu conventions (macOS menu bar, Windows system menu), drag-and-drop integration, and native theming.
