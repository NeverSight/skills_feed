Expert guidance on Swift Concurrency best practices, patterns, and implementation. Use when developers mention: (1) Swift Concurrency, async/await, actors, or tasks, (2) "use Swift Concurrency" or "modern concurrency patterns", (3) migrating to Swift 6, (4) data races or thread safety issues, (5) refactoring closures to async/await, (6) @MainActor, Sendable, or actor isolation, (7) concurrent code architecture or performance optimization, (8) concurrency-related linter warnings (SwiftLint or similar; e.g. async_without_await, Sendable/actor isolation/MainActor lint).
