Personal Knowledge Management documentation system based on Zettelkasten principles. Use when documenting conversations, decisions, development work, learnings, or any knowledge that should persist. Triggers on new projects, technical decisions, completed tasks, lessons learned, meeting notes, or when the user says "document this". Apply this workflow to all daily memory notes and long-term memory updates.
