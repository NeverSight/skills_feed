Agent Teams orchestration playbook for Claude Code. This skill should be used when the user asks to "create agent teams", "use agent swarm", "setup multi-agent collaboration", "orchestrate agents", "coordinate parallel agents", "organize team collaboration", "build agent teams", "implement swarm orchestration", "setup multi-agent system", "coordinate agent collaboration", or needs guidance on adaptive team formation, quality gates, skill discovery, task distribution, team coordination strategies, or Agent Teams best practices. 或者当用户说"多agent"、"agent协作"、"agent编排"、"并行agent"、"分工协作"、"拉团队"、"拉个团队"、"多代理协作"、"swarm编排"、"agent团队"时也应使用此技能。Note: "swarm/蜂群" is a generic industry term; Claude Code's official concept is "Agent Teams".
