Azure Resource Manager SDK for Cosmos DB in .NET. Use for MANAGEMENT PLANE operations: creating/managing Cosmos DB accounts, databases, containers, throughput settings, and RBAC via Azure Resource Manager. NOT for data plane operations (CRUD on documents) - use Microsoft.Azure.Cosmos for that. Triggers: "Cosmos DB account", "create Cosmos account", "manage Cosmos resources", "ARM Cosmos", "CosmosDBAccountResource", "provision Cosmos DB".
