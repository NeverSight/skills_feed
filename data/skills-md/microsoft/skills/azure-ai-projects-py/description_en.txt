Build AI applications using the Azure AI Projects Python SDK (azure-ai-projects). Use when working with Foundry project clients, creating versioned agents with PromptAgentDefinition, running evaluations, managing connections/deployments/datasets/indexes, or using OpenAI-compatible clients. This is the high-level Foundry SDK - for low-level agent operations, use azure-ai-agents-python skill.
