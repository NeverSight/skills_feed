Azure Resource Manager SDK for Microsoft Playwright Testing in .NET. Use for MANAGEMENT PLANE operations: creating/managing Playwright Testing workspaces, checking name availability, and managing workspace quotas via Azure Resource Manager. NOT for running Playwright tests - use Azure.Developer.MicrosoftPlaywrightTesting.NUnit for that. Triggers: "Playwright workspace", "create Playwright Testing workspace", "manage Playwright resources", "ARM Playwright", "PlaywrightWorkspaceResource", "provision Playwright Testing".
