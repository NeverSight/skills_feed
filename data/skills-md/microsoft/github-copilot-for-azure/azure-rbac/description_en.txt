USE FOR: "what role should I assign", "least privilege role", "RBAC role for", "role to read blobs", "role for managed identity", "custom role definition", "assign role to identity".
DO NOT USE FOR: creating or configuring managed identities, or general Azure security hardening; those are out of scope for this role-selection skill.
