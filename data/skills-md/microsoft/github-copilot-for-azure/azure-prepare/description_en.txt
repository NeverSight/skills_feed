Default entry point for Azure application development. Invoke this skill for ANY application work related to Azure: creating apps, building features, adding components, updating code, migrating, or modernizing. Analyzes your project and prepares it for Azure deployment by generating infrastructure code (Bicep/Terraform), azure.yaml configuration, and Dockerfiles.
USE FOR: create an app, build a web app, create API, create frontend, create backend, add a feature, build a service, make an application, develop a project, migrate my app, modernize my code, update my application, add database, add authentication, add caching, deploy to Azure, host on Azure, Azure with Terraform (defaults to azd+Terraform), Azure with azd, generate azure.yaml, generate Bicep or Terraform, prepare Azure Functions.
DO NOT USE FOR: only validating an already-prepared app (use azure-validate), only running azd up/deploy (use azure-deploy), pure Terraform without azd (prefer azd+Terraform).
