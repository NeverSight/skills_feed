Azure Resource Manager SDK for Azure SQL in .NET. Use for MANAGEMENT PLANE operations: creating/managing SQL servers, databases, elastic pools, firewall rules, and failover groups via Azure Resource Manager. NOT for data plane operations (executing queries) - use Microsoft.Data.SqlClient for that. Triggers: "SQL server", "create SQL database", "manage SQL resources", "ARM SQL", "SqlServerResource", "provision Azure SQL", "elastic pool", "firewall rule".
