Refactor bloated AGENTS.md, CLAUDE.md, or similar agent instruction files to follow progressive disclosure principles. Splits monolithic files into organized, linked documentation. Use when (1) agent context files are too large or unwieldy, (2) need to separate project context from executable skills, (3) want to create modular documentation structure, (4) refactoring existing documentation for better organization, or (5) creating new agent context documentation from scratch.
