Draft methods sections for academic manuscripts following a structured, narrative style. Use when the user needs to write or refine a methods section for research papers involving computational methods (machine learning, statistical modeling, text analysis, simulation, network analysis, image processing, or other computational approaches). Produces clear, accessible prose without em-dashes or bullet points, with appropriate appendix cross-references for technical details.
