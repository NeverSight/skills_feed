Meta-skill that teaches the Agent how to discover, select, execute, chain, and observe skills in the skill system. Load this skill when you need to: (1) find which skill can handle a capability, (2) execute a skill operation via its entrypoint, (3) chain multiple skill operations together, (4) check policy before executing, or (5) log skill execution for observability. This skill makes YOU the router — you decide what to run, in what order, based on context.
