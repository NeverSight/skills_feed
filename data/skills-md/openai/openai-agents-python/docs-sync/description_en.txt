Analyze main branch implementation and configuration to find missing, incorrect, or outdated documentation in docs/. Use when asked to audit doc coverage, sync docs with code, or propose doc updates/structure changes. Only update English docs under docs/** and never touch translated docs under docs/ja, docs/ko, or docs/zh. Provide a report and ask for approval before editing docs.
