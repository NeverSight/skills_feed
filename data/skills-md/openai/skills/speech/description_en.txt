Use when the user asks for text-to-speech narration or voiceover, accessibility reads, audio prompts, or batch speech generation via the OpenAI Audio API; run the bundled CLI (`scripts/text_to_speech.py`) with built-in voices and require `OPENAI_API_KEY` for live calls. Custom voice creation is out of scope.
