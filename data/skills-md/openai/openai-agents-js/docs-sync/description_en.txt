Analyze main branch implementation and configuration to find missing, incorrect, or outdated documentation in docs/. Use when asked to audit doc coverage, sync docs with code, or propose doc updates/structure changes. Only update English docs (docs/src/content/docs/**) and never touch translated docs under docs/src/content/docs/ja, ko, or zh. Provide a report and ask for approval before editing docs.
