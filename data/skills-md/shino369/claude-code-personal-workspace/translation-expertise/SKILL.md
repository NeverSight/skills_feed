# Translation Expertise

## Overview

This skill provides comprehensive translation expertise for English, Japanese, and Traditional Chinese. It covers translation methodologies, cultural considerations, and best practices for producing high-quality translations.

## Translation Philosophy

### Core Principles

1. **Meaning over Literalness**: Convey the intended meaning rather than word-for-word translation
2. **Cultural Adaptation**: Adapt content for the target culture while preserving the original intent
3. **Natural Flow**: Translations should read naturally in the target language
4. **Contextual Accuracy**: Consider the broader context, not just individual words
5. **Tone Preservation**: Maintain the original tone (formal, casual, technical, emotional)

## Language-Specific References

For comprehensive information about each language, see the dedicated language reference files:

### [English](./english.md)

**Key Features**: SVO word order, explicit subjects and articles, direct communication style, active voice preference.

**Contains**: Structural features, formality indicators (informal/formal/academic), punctuation conventions, common idioms, phrasal verbs, modal verbs, translation strategies, regional variations (US/UK).

### [Japanese (日本語)](./japanese.md)

**Key Features**: SOV word order, context-dependent subject omission, three writing systems (hiragana, katakana, kanji), elaborate honorific systems (keigo).

**Contains**: All five politeness levels (plain, polite, respectful, humble, beautification) with detailed explanations, gendered speech patterns, particle usage, writing system guidelines, translation strategies, cultural concepts.

### [Chinese Traditional (繁體中文)](./chinese-traditional.md)

**Key Features**: SVO word order like English, no verb conjugation, measure words (classifiers) for counting, rich idiomatic expressions (成語).

**Contains**: Comprehensive measure word list, regional variations (Taiwan/Hong Kong/Macau), four-character idioms (成語), formality indicators, punctuation conventions, translation strategies, terminology differences.

## Translation Workflow

### Step 1: Initial Translation

**Process**:

1. Read the entire source text to understand context and intent
2. Identify key terminology and create a glossary
3. Translate section by section, maintaining context
4. Mark uncertain translations for review

**Considerations**:

- Understand the source culture and references
- Identify the target audience
- Determine appropriate formality level
- Note any ambiguities requiring clarification

### Step 2: Proofreading & Review

**Grammar and Syntax Check**:

- Verify sentence structure is natural in target language
- Check verb tenses and aspects
- Ensure particles (JA) or measure words (ZH) are correct
- Validate punctuation follows target language conventions (see language-specific files)

**Terminology Consistency**:

- Ensure consistent translation of key terms
- Verify technical terms are accurate
- Check proper nouns are handled correctly
- Confirm units and measurements are appropriate

**Cultural Adaptation**:

- Verify idioms are culturally appropriate (see [translation-challenges.md](./translation-challenges.md))
- Check for culturally sensitive content
- Ensure examples and analogies work in target culture
- Adapt humor if necessary

**Tone and Style**:

- Maintain consistent tone throughout
- Ensure formality level matches the source
- Verify the text flows naturally
- Check that emphasis and nuance are preserved

### Step 3: Refinement Translation

**Enhancement Process**:

1. Review feedback from proofreading
2. Resolve all marked uncertainties
3. Improve awkward phrasings
4. Polish for naturalness and readability
5. Final consistency check

**Quality Markers**:

- Reads naturally to native speakers
- Accurately conveys source meaning
- Maintains appropriate tone and style
- Consistent terminology throughout
- Free of grammatical errors

## Common Translation Challenges

> **Detailed Examples**: See [translation-challenges.md](./translation-challenges.md) for extensive examples with reasoning.

### Challenge 1: Idioms and Expressions

**Strategy**: Find equivalent expressions, not word-for-word translations.

**Examples**: "Break a leg" → 頑張って (JA) / 加油 (ZH); "Piece of cake" → 朝飯前 (JA) / 小菜一碟 (ZH)

### Challenge 2: Cultural References

**Strategy**: Adapt or explain references unfamiliar to target culture.

**Approaches**: Direct + explanation, cultural adaptation to equivalent concept, or generalization depending on context importance.

### Challenge 3: Wordplay and Puns

**Strategy**: Recreate the effect, not the exact wordplay.

**Approach**: Either explain the original wordplay with translator's note, or create new language-specific wordplay that achieves similar humor effect.

### Challenge 4: Formality Levels

**Strategy**: Match formality indicators across languages.

**Key**: English uses vocabulary and contractions; Japanese uses verb endings and honorifics; Chinese uses vocabulary and pronouns (你/您).

### Challenge 5: Ambiguity Resolution

**Strategy**: Use context clues, research, and informed judgment when source is ambiguous.

**Process**: Analyze context, research domain-specific meanings, apply logic, choose most likely interpretation, and document reasoning.

> **For Detailed Examples**: See [translation-challenges.md](./translation-challenges.md) for comprehensive examples with solutions.

## Punctuation Quick Reference

**Key Differences** (See language-specific files for complete details):

- Period: . (EN) → 。(JA/ZH)
- Comma: , (EN) → 、(JA) / 、or , (ZH)
- Quotation marks: "..." (EN) →「...」(JA/ZH) or "..." (ZH alternative)
- Book titles: "..." (EN) → 『...』(JA) /《...》(ZH)
- Ellipsis: ... (EN) → …… (JA/ZH - six dots)

**Important**: Use full-width punctuation for Japanese and Chinese text. Maintain consistency throughout the document.

> **Detailed Conventions**: See [english.md](./english.md), [japanese.md](./japanese.md), or [chinese-traditional.md](./chinese-traditional.md) for complete punctuation rules.

## Quick Reference

**When translating, remember**:

1. Read entire source text first for context
2. Create terminology glossary for consistency
3. Choose appropriate formality level early
4. Handle idioms culturally, not literally
5. Verify punctuation conventions for target language

8. Document difficult translation decisions

**Default choices when uncertain**:

- **Japanese**: Use です/ます polite form unless clear context suggests otherwise
- **Chinese**: Use 您 for formal contexts, 你 for casual; prefer Taiwan terminology unless specified
- **Punctuation**: Use「」for quotes in JA/ZH Taiwan style; use《》for book titles in Chinese
- **Idioms**: When direct equivalent unclear, prioritize conveying meaning over preserving metaphor
