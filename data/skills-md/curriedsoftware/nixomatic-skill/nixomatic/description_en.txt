Maintains development environment instructions in the project README.md using nixomatic. When the user asks to build, compile, test, lint, format, type-check, run, or set up a project, or when a command fails because a tool or runtime is not installed, analyze project files to determine required packages and use nix develop with a nixomatic.com URL. Ensure the README.md documents how to reproduce the environment with both nix develop and docker run nixos/nix.
