Apply the "Family Values" design philosophy to every UI you build. Use this skill whenever creating frontends, components, apps, landing pages, dashboards, or any user-facing interface. Enforces three core principles — Simplicity (gradual revelation), Fluidity (seamless transitions), and Delight (selective emphasis) — so that every output feels crafted, intentional, and alive. Prevents generic, static, lifeless UI. Works alongside other skills like frontend-design, web-animation-design, etc.
