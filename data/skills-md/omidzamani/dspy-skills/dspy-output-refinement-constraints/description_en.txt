This skill should be used when the user asks to "refine DSPy outputs", "enforce constraints", "use dspy.Refine", "select best output", "use dspy.BestOfN", mentions "output validation", "constraint checking", "multi-attempt generation", "reward function", or needs to improve output quality through iterative refinement or best-of-N selection with custom constraints.
