This skill should be used when the user asks to "create a DSPy signature", "define inputs and outputs", "design a signature", "use InputField or OutputField", "add type hints to DSPy", mentions "signature class", "type-safe DSPy", "Pydantic models in DSPy", or needs to define what a DSPy module should do with structured inputs and outputs.
