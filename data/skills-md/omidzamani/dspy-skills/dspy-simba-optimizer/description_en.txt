This skill should be used when the user asks to "optimize with SIMBA", "use Bayesian optimization", "optimize agents with custom feedback", mentions "SIMBA optimizer", "mini-batch optimization", "statistical optimization", "lightweight optimizer", or needs an alternative to MIPROv2/GEPA for programs with rich feedback signals.
