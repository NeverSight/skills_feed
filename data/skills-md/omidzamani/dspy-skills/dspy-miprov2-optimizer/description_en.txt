This skill should be used when the user asks to "optimize a DSPy program", "use MIPROv2", "tune instructions and demos", "get best DSPy performance", "run Bayesian optimization", mentions "state-of-the-art DSPy optimizer", "joint instruction tuning", or needs maximum performance from a DSPy program with substantial training data (200+ examples).
