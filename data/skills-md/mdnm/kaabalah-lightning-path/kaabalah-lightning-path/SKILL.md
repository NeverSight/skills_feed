description: Use the Kaabalah Lightning Path (Kether→Malkuth) to structure plans, research, learning goals, and project execution. Trigger when you need to turn a vague idea into a concrete plan with clear scope (“what/why”), architecture/components, definition of done, risks/constraints, dependencies (people/tools/contracts), QA/success metrics, and a concrete launch outcome.

# Kaabalah Lightning Path

Use this workflow when a task feels fuzzy but important.

Goal
- convert intent into a plan you can execute

## workflow

1) write the lightning path (short)
- use the template: `references/lightning-path-template.md`
- keep each node to 1–5 bullets

2) confirm the critical nodes
- kether: what + why
- binah: components + definition of done
- geburah: risks + legal/compliance
- yesod: success metric + qa

3) act
- create the daath artifact (doc/pitch/prototype)
- then execute the plan

## output format (recommended)

Write headings exactly like:
- kether (WILL)
- chokhmah (vision)
- binah (sound / order)
- daath (expression)
- chesed (pros)
- geburah (cons + discipline)
- tipharet (harmony)
- netzach (silent victory)
- hod (connections)
- yesod (foundation)
- malkuth (manifested)

## notes

- keep it practical
- don’t announce too early (netzach)
- if money spend or contacting people is involved, escalate to the user per their policy
