# Frontend Design Skill

This skill guides creation of distinctive, production-grade frontend interfaces that avoid generic "AI slop" aesthetics. Implement real working code with exceptional attention to aesthetic details and creative choices.

The user provides frontend requirements: a component, page, application, or interface to build. They may include context about the purpose, audience, or technical constraints.

## Design Thinking

Before coding, understand the context and commit to a BOLD aesthetic direction:

- **Purpose**: What problem does this interface solve? Who uses it?
- **Tone**: Pick an extreme aesthetic direction:
  - Brutally minimal
  - Maximalist chaos
  - Retro-futuristic
  - Organic/natural
  - Luxury/refined
  - Playful/toy-like
  - Editorial/magazine
  - Brutalist/raw
  - Art deco/geometric
  - Soft/pastel
  - Industrial/utilitarian
  
  Use these for inspiration but design one that is true to the aesthetic direction.

- **Constraints**: Technical requirements (framework, performance, accessibility)
- **Differentiation**: What makes this UNFORGETTABLE? What's the one thing someone will remember?

**CRITICAL**: Choose a clear conceptual direction and execute it with precision. Bold maximalism and refined minimalism both work - the key is intentionality, not intensity.

## Implementation Standards

Implement working code (HTML/CSS/JS, React, Vue, etc.) that is:
- Production-grade and functional
- Visually striking and memorable
- Cohesive with a clear aesthetic point-of-view
- Meticulously refined in every detail

## Frontend Aesthetics Guidelines

### Typography
- Choose fonts that are beautiful, unique, and interesting
- Avoid generic fonts like Arial and Inter
- Use distinctive choices that elevate the frontend's aesthetics
- Pair a distinctive display font with a refined body font
- NEVER converge on common choices (Space Grotesk, Inter, Roboto, system fonts)

### Color & Theme
- Commit to a cohesive aesthetic
- Use CSS variables for consistency
- Dominant colors with sharp accents outperform timid, evenly-distributed palettes
- Vary between light and dark themes across different components

### Motion & Animation
- Use animations for effects and micro-interactions
- Prioritize CSS-only solutions for HTML
- Use Motion library for React when available
- Focus on high-impact moments: one well-orchestrated page load with staggered reveals (animation-delay)
- Use scroll-triggering and hover states that surprise

### Spatial Composition
- Unexpected layouts
- Asymmetry
- Overlap
- Diagonal flow
- Grid-breaking elements
- Generous negative space OR controlled density

### Backgrounds & Visual Details
Create atmosphere and depth rather than defaulting to solid colors. Add contextual effects and textures that match the overall aesthetic:
- Gradient meshes
- Noise textures
- Geometric patterns
- Layered transparencies
- Dramatic shadows
- Decorative borders
- Custom cursors
- Grain overlays

## What to AVOID

NEVER use generic AI-generated aesthetics:
- Overused font families (Inter, Roboto, Arial, system fonts, Space Grotesk)
- Cliched color schemes (particularly purple gradients on white backgrounds)
- Predictable layouts and component patterns
- Cookie-cutter design that lacks context-specific character

## Design Variation

- No design should be the same
- Vary between light and dark themes
- Use different fonts for different projects
- Apply different aesthetics to different components
- Interpret creatively and make unexpected choices that feel genuinely designed for the context

## Implementation Complexity

Match implementation complexity to the aesthetic vision:
- **Maximalist designs**: Need elaborate code with extensive animations and effects
- **Minimalist designs**: Need restraint, precision, and careful attention to spacing, typography, and subtle details
- Elegance comes from executing the vision well

## Remember

Don't hold back. Show what can truly be created when thinking outside the box and committing fully to a distinctive vision. Create extraordinary, creative work that is genuinely distinctive and memorable.
