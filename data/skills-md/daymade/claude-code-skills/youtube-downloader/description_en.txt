Download YouTube videos and HLS streams (m3u8) from platforms like Mux, Vimeo, etc. using yt-dlp and ffmpeg. Use this skill when users request downloading videos, extracting audio, handling protected streams with authentication headers, or troubleshooting download issues like nsig extraction failures, 403 errors, or cookie extraction problems.
