Transform vague prompts into precise, well-structured specifications using EARS (Easy Approach to Requirements Syntax) methodology. This skill should be used when users provide loose requirements, ambiguous feature descriptions, or need to enhance prompts for AI-generated code, products, or documents. Triggers include requests to "optimize my prompt", "improve this requirement", "make this more specific", or when raw requirements lack detail and structure.
