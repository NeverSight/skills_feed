Diagnose and fix conflicts between Tailscale and proxy/VPN tools (Shadowrocket, Clash, Surge) on macOS. Covers two conflict types - route hijacking (proxy TUN overrides Tailscale routes) and HTTP proxy env var interception (http_proxy/NO_PROXY misconfiguration). Use when Tailscale ping works but SSH/HTTP times out, when curl to Tailscale IPs returns empty/timeout, or when setting up Tailscale SSH to WSL instances.
