Transforms raw meeting transcripts into high-fidelity, structured meeting minutes with iterative review for completeness. This skill should be used when (1) a meeting transcript is provided and meeting minutes, notes, or summaries are requested, (2) multiple versions of meeting minutes need to be merged without losing content, (3) existing minutes need to be reviewed against the original transcript for missing items, (4) transcript has anonymous speakers like "Speaker 1/2/3" that need identification. Features include: speaker identification via feature analysis (word count, speaking style, topic focus) with context.md team directory mapping, intelligent file naming from content, integration with transcript-fixer for pre-processing, evidence-based recording with speaker quotes, Mermaid diagrams for architecture discussions, multi-turn parallel generation to avoid content loss, and iterative human-in-the-loop refinement.
