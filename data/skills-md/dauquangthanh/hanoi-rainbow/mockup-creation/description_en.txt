Create interactive, production-ready UI mockups and prototypes using NuxtJS 4 (Vue) or Next.js (React), TypeScript, and TailwindCSS v4. Use when building web mockups, prototypes, landing pages, dashboards, admin panels, or interactive UI demonstrations. Trigger when users mention "create mockup", "build prototype", "interactive demo", "UI prototype", "design to code", or need rapid frontend development with modern tooling. Prefer NuxtJS for Vue-based projects; use Next.js when users mention ReactJS.
