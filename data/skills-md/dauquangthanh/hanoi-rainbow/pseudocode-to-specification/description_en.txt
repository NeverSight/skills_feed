Analyzes pseudocode, algorithms, or code snippets to extract and document functional requirements and business specifications. Produces functional specifications, business logic documentation, data requirements, and workflow specifications focused exclusively on WHAT the system does, not HOW it's implemented. Use when analyzing pseudocode for business logic, extracting functional requirements from algorithms, documenting business behavior from code, reverse engineering functional specifications, or when users mention "pseudocode to spec", "extract requirements", "business logic documentation", "functional specification from code", or "requirements from pseudocode".
