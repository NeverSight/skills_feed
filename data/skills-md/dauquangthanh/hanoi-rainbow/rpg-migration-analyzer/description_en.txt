Analyzes legacy RPG (Report Program Generator) programs from AS/400 and IBM i systems for migration to modern Java applications. Extracts business logic from RPG III/IV/ILE source code, identifies data structures (D-specs), file operations (F-specs), program dependencies (CALLB/CALLP), and converts RPG constructs to Java equivalents. Generates migration reports, complexity estimates, and Java implementation strategies with POJO classes, JPA entities, and service methods. Use when modernizing AS/400 or IBM i legacy systems, analyzing RPG source files (.rpg, .rpgle, .RPGLE), converting RPG to Java, mapping data specifications to Java classes, planning legacy system migration, or when user mentions RPG analysis, Report Program Generator, RPG III/IV/ILE, AS/400 modernization, IBM i migration, packed decimal conversion, or mainframe application rewrite.
