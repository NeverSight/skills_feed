Best practices for using Cursor—rules, commands, skills, subagents, ignore files, Agent security, workflows, and community resources. Use when setting up Cursor, initializing or creating the .cursor folder, writing .cursor/rules or AGENTS.md, creating commands or skills, configuring .cursorignore, working with Agent, discovering rules or MCPs (e.g. cursor.directory), making codebases cursor-compatible, or asking about Cursor workflows, TDD, git commands, or large codebases.
