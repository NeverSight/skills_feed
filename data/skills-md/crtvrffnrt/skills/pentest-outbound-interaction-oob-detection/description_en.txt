Security assessment skill for outbound interaction and out-of-band (OOB) validation. Use when prompts include SSRF callback confirmation, blind XSS beacons, webhook abuse, XXE/OOB behavior, DNS/HTTP callback correlation, or asynchronous server-side interaction proof. Do not use when vulnerabilities are fully in-band and require no external callback correlation.
