Security assessment skill for business workflow abuse, state-machine manipulation, and control-plane logic flaws. Use when prompts include workflow bypass, race condition, replay, quota abuse, order-of-operations flaws, delegated execution abuse, or unauthorized state transitions. Do not use for pure input injection fuzzing, broad recon, or standalone report formatting tasks.
