Security assessment skill for authentication and authorization controls. Use when prompts include session handling, token abuse, MFA weaknesses, account takeover, IDOR/BOLA/BFLA, privilege escalation, tenant isolation, or identity boundary validation. Do not use when the task is generic recon, pure parser fuzzing, or final report composition only.
