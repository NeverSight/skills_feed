Manage music releases using RELEASE.md documents stored in releases/{release-slug}/ within an artist workspace. Triggers when the user mentions an artist's album, EP, single, or project — or asks about release planning, DSP pitches, metadata, marketing, press materials, physical production, or tour coordination. First infer which artist and release the user means, then find or create the RELEASE.md. Use this skill to create, update, or pull data from release documents, and to generate deliverables like DSP pitches, press one-sheets, and production specs.
