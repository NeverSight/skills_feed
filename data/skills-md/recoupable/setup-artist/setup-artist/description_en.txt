Set up the workspace for a new artist inside a sandbox. Creates the directory structure, context files, memory system, and placeholder content so agents can immediately start working. Use after setup-sandbox has created the org/artist folders, when RECOUP.md has status not-setup. Triggers on "set up artist", "create artist workspace", "initialize artist", or "onboard new artist".
