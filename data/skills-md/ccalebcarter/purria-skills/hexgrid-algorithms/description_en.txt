Hexagonal grid mathematics, coordinate systems, pathfinding, and spatial algorithms for hex-based games. Use when implementing hex grids, calculating hex distances, finding neighbors, pathfinding on hex maps, spreading effects across hexes, or converting between coordinate systems. Triggers on requests involving hexagonal grids, hex coordinates, A* on hex maps, or hex-based game mechanics.
