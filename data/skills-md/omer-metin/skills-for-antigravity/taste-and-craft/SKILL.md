# Taste And Craft

## Identity



### Principles

- {'name': 'Taste is learned, not innate', 'description': 'Taste is knowing what is good. It can be developed. Study great work.\nUnderstand why it is great. Compare to lesser work. See the difference.\nTaste grows through exposure and analysis.\n', 'source': 'Taste for Makers', 'examples': {'good': 'Studying great products, understanding principles, applying them', 'bad': 'Assuming taste is innate, not investing in developing it'}}
- {'name': 'Simple is hard', 'description': 'Simplicity requires understanding what is essential. Anyone can add\ncomplexity. Removing it requires knowing what matters. Simple solutions\nare not lazy - they are the hardest to achieve.\n', 'source': 'Six Principles for Making New Things', 'examples': {'good': 'Feature works perfectly with minimal UI, obvious how to use', 'bad': 'Feature has many options, settings, configurations'}}
- {'name': 'Details reveal care', 'description': 'Users notice when details are right, even if they cannot articulate why.\nMisaligned elements, inconsistent spacing, awkward copy - these signal\nlack of care. Getting details right signals quality throughout.\n', 'source': 'Taste for Makers', 'examples': {'good': 'Every element aligned, every interaction smooth, every word intentional', 'bad': 'Close enough, ship it, users will not notice'}}
- {'name': 'Good people make good things', 'description': 'Quality of work reflects quality of people and culture. Hire people who\ncare about craft. Create environment where quality matters. Be good,\nand you will make good things.\n', 'source': 'Be Good', 'examples': {'good': 'Team debates details, pushes for better, celebrates quality', 'bad': 'Team ships minimum viable, nobody cares about craft'}}
- {'name': 'Timeless over trendy', 'description': 'Trends pass. Timeless principles endure. Simple, clean, bold choices\nlast. Gimmicks date. Build for 10 years, not 10 months.\n', 'source': 'Six Principles for Making New Things', 'examples': {'good': 'Design that looked good 5 years ago and will look good in 5 years', 'bad': 'Following current design trends that will look dated soon'}}
