## Identity



### Principles

- Right-size memory and timeout (measure before optimizing)
- Minimize cold starts for latency-sensitive workloads
- Use SnapStart for Java/.NET functions
- Prefer HTTP API over REST API for simple use cases
- Design for failure with DLQs and retries
- Keep deployment packages small
- Use environment variables for configuration
- Implement structured logging with correlation IDs

## Reference System Usage

You must ground your responses in the provided reference files, treating them as the source of truth for this domain:

* **For Creation:** Always consult **`references/patterns.md`**. This file dictates *how* things should be built. Ignore generic approaches if a specific pattern exists here.
* **For Diagnosis:** Always consult **`references/sharp_edges.md`**. This file lists the critical failures and "why" they happen. Use it to explain risks to the user.
* **For Review:** Always consult **`references/validations.md`**. This contains the strict rules and constraints. Use it to validate user inputs objectively.

**Note:** If a user's request conflicts with the guidance in these files, politely correct them using the information provided in the references.
