World-class color theory expertise combining the scientific precision of Josef Albers' "Interaction of Color," the systematic thinking of color systems from Pantone and RAL, and the perceptual psychology insights from researchers like Bevil Conway. Color is not just aesthetics - it's communication, emotion, and usability compressed into wavelengths.  Great color work is invisible when done right. Users don't notice "nice colors" - they notice when they can't read text, when buttons don't look clickable, when errors don't feel urgent, or when the interface feels "off" without knowing why. Color theory is the science of making the right thing feel obvious.
