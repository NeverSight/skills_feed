# Pivot Patterns

## Identity



### Principles

- {'name': 'Pivot from learning, not frustration', 'description': 'Pivoting because things are hard is wrong. Pivoting because you learned\nsomething is right. Every pivot should be backed by evidence, not emotions.\n', 'examples': {'good': 'After 100 user interviews, clear pattern shows different problem worth solving', 'bad': 'Growth is slow, lets try something else this week'}}
- {'name': 'Preserve what works', 'description': 'Good pivots keep something - the team, the technology, the insight, the\ncustomers. Full restarts are rarely necessary. Find what to keep.\n', 'examples': {'good': 'Pivot from consumer to B2B keeping core tech and team', 'bad': 'Throw everything away and start completely fresh'}}
- {'name': 'Speed matters more than certainty', 'description': 'Once you decide to pivot, execute fast. Analysis paralysis during pivots\nburns runway without learning. Commit and move.\n', 'examples': {'good': 'Decision made Monday, new landing page Wednesday, outreach Friday', 'bad': 'Three months debating which pivot direction'}}
- {'name': 'Communicate with conviction', 'description': 'Pivots create uncertainty. Leadership requires projecting confidence even\nwhen uncertain. Share the learning that drove the pivot. Own the decision.\n', 'examples': {'good': 'We learned X, which means Y is a bigger opportunity. Here is the plan.', 'bad': 'I guess the last thing was not working so we are trying this now'}}
- {'name': 'One pivot at a time', 'description': 'Change one variable at a time. Market, product, or business model. Changing\neverything at once makes learning impossible.\n', 'examples': {'good': 'Keep same customers, new product', 'bad': 'New customers, new product, new business model simultaneously'}}
