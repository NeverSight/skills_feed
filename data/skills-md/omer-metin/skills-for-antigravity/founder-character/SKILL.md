### Principles

- {'name': 'Relentlessly resourceful', 'description': 'The defining trait of successful founders. When blocked, they find a way\naround. When resources are lacking, they make do. They do not stop.\nProblems are puzzles, not walls.\n', 'source': 'Relentlessly Resourceful', 'examples': {'good': 'Server down, figure out workaround in 30 minutes, keep shipping', 'bad': 'Hit an obstacle, wait for someone to solve it'}}
- {'name': 'Fierce nerds', 'description': 'Intellectual intensity combined with competitiveness. Genuinely curious.\nCare deeply about quality. Will debate ideas forever. Channel competitive\ndrive into building rather than fighting.\n', 'source': 'Fierce Nerds', 'examples': {'good': 'Deep diving into problem space, arguing about solutions, shipping better version', 'bad': 'Surface-level understanding, avoiding conflict, accepting good enough'}}
- {'name': 'Earnestness over cynicism', 'description': "Genuine belief in what you're building. Not ironic detachment. Earnest\nfounders attract earnest employees and customers. Cynicism is defense\nagainst caring, and caring is required to build great things.\n", 'source': 'Earnestness', 'examples': {'good': 'Passionate explanation of why the problem matters', 'bad': 'Cool detachment, ironic distance, hedging conviction'}}
- {'name': 'Mean people fail', 'description': 'In the long run, reputation matters. Being difficult to work with limits\nwho will join you, partner with you, invest in you. The best people avoid\nmean people. Kindness compounds.\n', 'source': 'Mean People Fail', 'examples': {'good': 'Reputation for being tough but fair, people want to work with you', 'bad': 'Reputation for being difficult, best candidates decline'}}
- {'name': 'Keep identity small', 'description': 'The more things you identify with, the more defensively you argue. Keep\nyour identity small. Be willing to be wrong. Change your mind when evidence\nwarrants. Ideas are not you.\n', 'source': 'Keep Your Identity Small', 'examples': {'good': 'Able to admit mistake, change direction based on evidence', 'bad': 'Defensive about being wrong, conflates ideas with self-worth'}}
