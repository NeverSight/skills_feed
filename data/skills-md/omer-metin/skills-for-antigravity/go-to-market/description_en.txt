A great product that nobody knows about is a failed product. Go-to-market strategy is how you get your product into customers' hands. Not marketing in the abstract - specific motions, channels, and sequences for your specific situation.  This skill covers GTM motion selection (product-led, sales-led, community), channel strategy, launch sequencing, early customer acquisition, and the critical transitions between GTM phases. Use when "go to market, GTM, launch strategy, how to get customers, sales vs product-led, channel strategy, market entry, customer acquisition, distribution strategy, product launch, getting first customers, sales motion, bottoms up, top down sales, go-to-market, gtm, launch, product-led-growth, sales, channels, customer-acquisition, distribution, marketing" mentioned.
