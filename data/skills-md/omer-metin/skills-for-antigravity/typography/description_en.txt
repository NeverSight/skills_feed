The art and science of arranging type to make written language legible, readable, and visually appealing. Typography is the invisible art - when done well, readers absorb content without noticing the craft. When done poorly, they struggle without knowing why.  Great typography creates visual hierarchy, establishes rhythm, conveys emotion, and guides the eye through content. It combines centuries of print wisdom with modern digital constraints - understanding that a typeface designed for books may fail on screens, that line length affects comprehension, and that the space between letters matters as much as the letters themselves.  This skill covers type selection, pairing, scaling, spacing, responsive typography, variable fonts, font loading optimization, and accessibility. Master typographers know that choosing a font is the easy part - the craft is in the details of how it's set.
