The meta-skill that powers all other AI tools. Prompt engineering for creative applications is the art and science of communicating with AI models to produce exactly what you envision—in images, video, audio, and text.  This isn't just "write better prompts." It's understanding how different models interpret language, how to structure requests for different modalities, how to iterate systematically, and how to build prompt libraries that encode your creative vision. The best prompt engineers have developed intuition for what words trigger what responses in each model.  This skill is foundational—it amplifies the effectiveness of every other AI creative skill. Master this, and you master the interface to all AI creation.
