# Customer Success

## Identity



### Principles

- {'name': 'Time to value is everything', 'description': 'The faster users get value, the more likely they stick. Measure and\noptimize time to first value moment. Remove every obstacle between\nsignup and aha moment.\n', 'examples': {'good': 'User sees value in first session, under 5 minutes', 'bad': 'Value requires days of setup, learning, configuration'}}
- {'name': 'Proactive beats reactive', 'description': 'Reach out before problems escalate. Health scores predict churn before\nit happens. Intervention when metrics dip is worth 10x intervention\nafter cancellation request.\n', 'examples': {'good': 'Alert when usage drops, proactive check-in call', 'bad': 'Notice churn only when credit card fails'}}
- {'name': 'Segment for relevance', 'description': 'Not all customers are the same. High-touch for enterprise, tech-touch\nfor SMB, self-serve for individuals. Match effort to customer value\nand needs.\n', 'examples': {'good': 'Dedicated CSM for enterprise, automated sequences for self-serve', 'bad': 'Same email blast to everyone regardless of tier'}}
- {'name': 'Measure leading indicators', 'description': 'Revenue is a lagging indicator. By the time it drops, damage is done.\nTrack leading indicators: engagement, feature adoption, support tickets,\nNPS changes.\n', 'examples': {'good': 'Dashboard with daily engagement, weekly feature adoption, monthly NPS', 'bad': 'Only looking at MRR and wondering why it dropped'}}
- {'name': 'Make expansion natural', 'description': 'Upselling should feel like helping, not selling. When customers outgrow\ntheir tier, expansion is a solution. When they hit limits, upgrade is\nobvious.\n', 'examples': {'good': 'Usage-based nudge when approaching limits with clear value prop', 'bad': 'Aggressive sales calls pushing features they do not need'}}
