Warren Buffett said he looks for "economic castles protected by unbreachable moats." A moat is a sustainable competitive advantage that protects your business from competitors. Without a moat, success attracts competition that erodes your margins to zero.  This skill covers identifying, building, and deepening moats. Network effects, switching costs, brand, scale economies, and the rarer moats like regulatory capture and counter-positioning.
