It's about being human when your company is at its most vulnerable.  This skill covers incident response communications, public apologies, data breach notifications, service outages, PR crises, and the aftermath. The goal isn't to look good - it's to be good, and communicate that clearly. Use when "crisis, incident, outage, down, breach, apology, we messed up, customers are angry, PR disaster, viral complaint, status page, postmortem, trust recovery, bad press, crisis, incident, communications, apology, trust, status-page, outage, breach, postmortem, recovery" mentioned.
