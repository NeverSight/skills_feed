Up-to-date es-toolkit documentation reference. Use when writing JavaScript/TypeScript code – writing new utility helpers, working with arrays/objects/Maps/Sets/Promises/math/string manipulation, refactoring code, reviewing code, evaluating whether a custom utility can be replaced with es-toolkit, or when explicitly asked to scan/refactor code toward es-toolkit functions (for example, "Go through the codebase and find potential cases where es-toolkit could be used instead of custom implementations")
