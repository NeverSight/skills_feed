This skill sets up a complete two-agent development system based on the "Effective Harnesses for Long-Running Agents" research. It creates initializer-agent (for project planning) and coding-agent (for incremental implementation), along with enforcement hooks and progress tracking infrastructure. Use when users ask to "set up two-agent system", "install agent harness", "configure Opus delegation", or want to implement the two-agent architecture pattern.
