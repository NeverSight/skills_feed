This skill should be used when debugging full-stack issues that span UI, backend, and database layers. It provides a systematic workflow to detect errors, analyze root causes, apply fixes iteratively, and verify solutions through automated server restarts and browser-based testing. Ideal for scenarios like failing schedulers, import errors, database issues, or API payload problems where issues originate in backend code but manifest in the UI.
