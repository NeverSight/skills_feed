Parallel C++ Core Guidelines code review using multiple specialized sub-agents. Use when reviewing C++ code, modules, or files against C++ Core Guidelines to identify violations. Each sub-agent reviews against a specific guideline section (Functions, Classes, Resource Management, etc.) and outputs findings to separate markdown files in the review/ directory, followed by a consolidated summary.
