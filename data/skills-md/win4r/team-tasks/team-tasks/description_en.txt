Coordinate multi-agent development pipelines using shared JSON task files. Use when dispatching work across dev team agents (code-agent, test-agent, docs-agent, monitor-bot), tracking pipeline progress, or running sequential/parallel workflows. Covers project init, task assignment, status tracking, agent dispatch via sessions_send, and result collection. Supports two modes: linear (sequential pipeline) and dag (dependency graph with parallel execution).
