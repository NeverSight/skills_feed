Execute a complete, deterministic, read-only repository audit and produce a single `improvements.md` action plan with traceable findings (file + lines), severity, category, impact, and high-level fixes. Use when users ask for full code audits, security/performance/architecture reviews, file-by-file analysis, or technical debt mapping without modifying project files.
