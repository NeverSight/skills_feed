TypeScript code style guide and formatting conventions. Use when writing TypeScript code, reviewing TypeScript files, refactoring .ts code, formatting TypeScript, or when working with TypeScript interfaces, classes, functions, or any .ts files. Apply these rules during code generation, code review, and when user mentions TypeScript style, formatting, conventions, semicolons, or code quality.
