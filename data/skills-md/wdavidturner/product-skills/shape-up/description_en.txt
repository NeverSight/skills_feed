Use when asked to "shape up", "run a shaping session", "set an appetite", "scope a project without estimates", "betting table", or "ship in fixed cycles". Helps teams escape estimate-driven development and Scrum fatigue. The Shape Up method (created by Ryan Singer at Basecamp/37signals) uses fixed time boxes, variable scope, and collaborative shaping to ship meaningful work predictably.
