Use when asked to "working backwards", "PR/FAQ", "Amazon PR/FAQ", "write a press release", "define a new product", or "write a customer-focused PRD". Helps define products by starting with the customer problem and desired outcome before building. The Working Backwards process (developed at Amazon) forces clarity on customer value before committing engineering resources.
