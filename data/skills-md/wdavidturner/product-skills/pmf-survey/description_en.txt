Use when asked to "PMF survey", "measure product-market fit", "40% rule", "Sean Ellis test", "Rahul Vohra method", or "how disappointed would you be". Helps quantify product-market fit and systematically improve it. The PMF Survey framework (created by Sean Ellis, popularized by Rahul Vohra at Superhuman) measures how disappointed users would be without your product and turns that data into a roadmap.
