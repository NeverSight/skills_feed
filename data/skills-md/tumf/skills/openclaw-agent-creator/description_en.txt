Create and maintain OpenClaw agent workspaces using the "Memory as Documentation" layout.
Use when you need to: (1) create a new OpenClaw workspace/profile, (2) generate bootstrap files
(AGENTS.md, SOUL.md, USER.md, IDENTITY.md, TOOLS.md, MEMORY.md, memory/YYYY-MM-DD.md),
(3) keep instructions/persona/memory separated and token-lean, or (4) set up a safe git backup
of an OpenClaw workspace without committing secrets.
