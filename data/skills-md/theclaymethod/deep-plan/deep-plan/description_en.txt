Structured research → plan → annotate → implement workflow for non-trivial features. Separates planning from execution using persistent markdown artifacts (.claude/research.md, .claude/plan.md). Use when explicitly invoked via /deep-plan for feature development, refactors, migrations, or any multi-file change where architecture decisions matter.
