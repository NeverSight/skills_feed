Transform AI-generated academic text into natural, human-like scholarly writing for social sciences. Detects AI patterns (repetitive structures, abstract language, mechanical flow) and rewrites with authentic academic voice. Use when revising AI-drafted papers, improving writing naturalness, reducing AI detection markers, or when user mentions humanizing text, academic writing quality, or social science writing for non-native English speakers.
