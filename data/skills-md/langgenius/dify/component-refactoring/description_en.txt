Refactor high-complexity React components in Dify frontend. Use when `pnpm analyze-component --json` shows complexity > 50 or lineCount > 300, when the user asks for code splitting, hook extraction, or complexity reduction, or when `pnpm analyze-component` warns to refactor before testing; avoid for simple/well-structured components, third-party wrappers, or when the user explicitly wants testing without refactoring.
