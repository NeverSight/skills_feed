Guides the daft worktree workflow for compartmentalized Git development. Use when working in daft-managed repositories (repos with a .git/ bare directory and branch worktrees as sibling directories), when setting up worktree environment isolation, or when users ask about worktree-based workflows. Covers daft commands, hooks automation via daft.yml, and environment tooling like mise, direnv, nvm, and pyenv.
