Remove signs of AI-generated writing from text. Use when the user mentions
'sounds like AI,' 'too robotic,' 'humanize this,' 'make it sound human,'
'de-AI this,' 'sounds like ChatGPT,' 'make it natural,' or 'doesn't sound
like a person wrote it.' Detects and fixes AI writing patterns including
inflated significance, promotional language, formulaic structure, AI vocabulary,
superficial analyses, vague attributions, hedging, robotic rhythm, em dash and
boldface overuse, chatbot artifacts, and missing personality. Based on
Wikipedia's "Signs of AI writing" guide and editorial best practices.
