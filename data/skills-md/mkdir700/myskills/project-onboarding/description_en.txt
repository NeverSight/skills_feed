Rapidly understand unfamiliar codebases through structured analysis. Use when the user needs to understand a new project, especially poorly documented or non-standard code. Triggers include "help me understand this project", "analyze this codebase", "onboard me to [project]", "what does this project do", or when the user provides a project path for exploration. Particularly effective for legacy code, hack projects, and codebases lacking documentation.
