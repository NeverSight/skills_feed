Autonomously validate and execute AI Review suggestions from PR comments. Use when users provide AI Review comments (from GitHub Copilot, CodeRabbit, etc.) that suggest code changes, API migrations, or fixes. The skill verifies suggestions against official docs, tests compilation, calculates confidence scores, and auto-applies changes when verified. Triggers on phrases like "verify this AI Review", "apply this suggestion", "validate AI Review comment", or when users paste AI Review URLs/content.
