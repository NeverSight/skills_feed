Personal knowledge management for Obsidian combining GTD, Zettelkasten, and PARA. Six workflows: (1) Capture - "capture this", "remember this", "save this thought", "note this down" - saves thoughts/tasks to daily inbox without categorization; (2) Process inbox - "process my inbox", "organize captures", "GTD processing" - clarifies items and routes to projects or permanent notes; (3) Daily plan - "plan my day", "what should I work on", "morning planning" - creates prioritized task list based on energy and context; (4) Daily closeout - "daily closeout", "review my day", "evening reflection" - marks progress and drafts tomorrow's plan; (5) Setup - "set up my second brain", "configure vault" - configures vault path and user goals; (6) Excalidraw - "create a diagram", "visualize this", "draw flowchart", "sketch this" - creates .excalidraw.md files with rectangles, ellipses, diamonds, arrows, lines, and text. Proactively offers to capture valuable insights during research conversations.
