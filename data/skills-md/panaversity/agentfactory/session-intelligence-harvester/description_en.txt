This skill should be used after productive sessions to extract learnings and route them to appropriate Reusable Intelligence Infrastructure (RII) components. Use when corrections were made, format drift was fixed, new patterns emerged, or the user explicitly asks to "harvest learnings" or "capture session intelligence". Transforms one-time fixes into permanent organizational knowledge by implementing updates across multiple files.
