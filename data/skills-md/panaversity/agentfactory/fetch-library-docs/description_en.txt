Fetches official documentation for external libraries and frameworks (React, Next.js, Prisma, FastAPI, Express, Tailwind, MongoDB, etc.) with 60-90% token savings via content-type filtering. Use this skill when implementing features using library APIs, debugging library-specific errors, troubleshooting configuration issues, installing or setting up frameworks, integrating third-party packages, upgrading between library versions, or looking up correct API patterns and best practices. Triggers automatically during coding work - fetch docs before writing library code to get correct patterns, not after guessing wrong.
