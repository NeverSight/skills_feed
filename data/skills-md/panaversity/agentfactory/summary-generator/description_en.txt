This skill should be used when generating lesson summaries for educational content. It extracts key concepts, mental models, patterns, and common mistakes from lesson markdown files using a Socratic extraction process. Use this skill when a lesson file needs a `.summary.md` companion file, or when reviewing/refreshing existing summaries.
