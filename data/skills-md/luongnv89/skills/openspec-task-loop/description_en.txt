Apply OpenSpec OPSX in a strict one-task-at-a-time loop. Use when the user asks to execute work as single-task changes, wants spec-first implementation per task, or says to use OpenSpec method for each task from a task list. Supports both native /opsx command environments and manual fallback by creating OpenSpec artifact files directly.
