Generate cross-platform installation scripts for any software, library, or module. Use when users ask to "create an installer", "generate installation script", "automate installation", "setup script for X", "install X on any OS", or need automated deployment across Windows, Linux, and macOS. The skill generates a standalone `install.sh` (and optionally `install.ps1`) script that can be run via a single curl/wget one-liner from GitHub raw user content. It follows a four-phase approach: (1) Environment exploration - detect OS, gather system info, check dependencies; (2) Installation planning - propose steps with verification; (3) Script generation - produce a self-contained install script with one-liner command; (4) Documentation generation.
