Capture chat notes (text, voice, image, video, file) into the git-backed notes repo, summarize and organize them, extract tasks into KANBAN.md, commit/push changes, and always report GitHub web links to new/updated notes. Use when user says they want to take a note, save a note, capture this, or manage their notes/backlog.
