Kotlin + Arrow typed error handling using Raise DSL and wrapper types (Either/Option/Ior/Result/nullable), including validation with accumulation, interop with exceptions, and custom error wrappers. Use for designing or refactoring error modeling, converting exception-based flows, building smart constructors, accumulating validation errors, or integrating Outcome/Progress-style wrappers with Arrow.
