Modern, clean UI/UX guidance + review skill. Use when you need actionable UX/UI recommendations, design principles, or a design review checklist for new features or existing systems (web/app). Focus on CRAP (Contrast/Repetition/Alignment/Proximity) plus task-first UX, information architecture, feedback & system status, consistency, affordances, error prevention/recovery, and cognitive load. Enforce a modern minimal style (clean, spacious, typography-led), reduce unnecessary copy, forbid emoji as icons, and recommend intuitive refined icons from a consistent icon set.
