GitHub-specific workflow to recompose a large, review-ready source branch into an ordered chain of smaller changesets (stacked branches + GitHub PRs) that preserve behavior and improve reviewability. Use when working with GitHub PR stacks via the gh CLI to split monolithic branches, create stacked PRs, merge reviewed changesets, and propagate/update downstream PR bases after merges.
