Semantic code search and AI-powered codebase Q&A across indexed repositories. Use when understanding code beyond local files, exploring dependencies, discovering cross-project patterns, planning features, debugging, or onboarding. Queries like "How does X work?", "Show me Y patterns", "How is library Z used?". Provides search (fast, returns file locations) and chat-with-codebase (slower, costs more, but returns synthesized answers).
