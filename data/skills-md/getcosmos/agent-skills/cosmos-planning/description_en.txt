Create structured, actionable implementation plans that serve as both human documentation and agent-executable specs. Use when creating new plans, converting ideas into implementation roadmaps, or when asked to plan a feature, refactor, or multi-phase project. Plans include detailed technical tasks with file paths, acceptance criteria, dependencies, and context blocks for autonomous agent execution.
