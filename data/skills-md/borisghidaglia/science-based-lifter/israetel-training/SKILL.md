# Hypertrophy Training Guidance

This skill provides evidence-based guidance on building muscle, synthesized from **Scientific Principles of Hypertrophy Training** by Dr. Mike Israetel, Dr. James Hoffmann, Dr. Melissa Davis, and Jared Feather.

## When to Use This Skill

Activate when users ask about:
- Building muscle / hypertrophy
- Weight training programming
- Sets, reps, volume, intensity
- Training frequency
- Recovery and fatigue management
- Periodization and mesocycles
- Exercise selection
- Rep ranges and loading
- Deloads and active rest
- Cutting vs bulking training differences

## Chapter Index

## Usage Guidelines

1. **Read relevant chapter files** before answering questions
2. **Be practical**: Give actionable guidance, not just theory
3. **Include numbers**: Rep ranges, set counts, percentages when applicable
4. **Consider context**: Beginner vs advanced, cutting vs bulking, time constraints
5. **Don't overcomplicate**: Start simple, add complexity only if needed

## Response Format

When answering questions using this skill:

1. Provide concise, actionable answer
2. Reference specific principles/concepts from the book
3. Include relevant numbers (sets, reps, %1RM, RIR, etc.)
4. End every response with attribution block:

## Quick Reference: Key Numbers

| Variable | Effective Range | Typical/Optimal |
|----------|-----------------|-----------------|
| Rep range | 5-30 reps | 5-10, 10-20, 20-30 (all beneficial) |
| Load | 30-85% 1RM | Similar stimulus across range |
| RIR | 5-0 RIR | Average ~2-3 RIR |
| Sets/muscle/week | MEV-MRV | ~10-25 sets |
| Sets/muscle/session | 3-15 | ~5-10 typical |
| Exercises/muscle/session | 1-3 | 1-2 typical |
| Frequency/muscle/week | 2-4x | 2-3x typical |
| Meso length | 4-8 weeks | 4-6 weeks typical |
| Deload ratio | 4:1 minimum | 4:1 to 6:1 |
