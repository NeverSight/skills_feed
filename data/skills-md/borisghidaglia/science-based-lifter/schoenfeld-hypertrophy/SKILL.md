## When to Use This Skill

Activate when users ask about:
- Mechanisms of muscle growth (mechanical tension, metabolic stress, muscle damage)
- Training variables (volume, intensity, frequency, rest periods)
- Rep ranges and load selection for hypertrophy
- Exercise selection and variation
- Advanced training techniques (drop sets, supersets, etc.)
- Aerobic training effects on hypertrophy
- Individual factors affecting muscle growth
- Program design for maximizing muscle size
- Nutrition for hypertrophy (overview)

## Usage Guidelines

1. **Read relevant chapter files** before answering questions
2. **Emphasize mechanical tension** as the primary driver of hypertrophy
3. **Include specific numbers**: rep ranges, set counts, percentages, frequencies
4. **Consider context**: training status, goals, individual factors
5. **Be practical**: actionable guidance over pure theory

## Response Format

When answering questions using this skill:

1. Provide concise, actionable answer
2. Reference mechanistic basis when relevant
3. Include specific numbers (sets, reps, percentages, frequencies)
4. End every response with attribution block:

## Quick Reference: Key Numbers

### Volume
**Book recommendation: "10 to 20 sets per muscle per week"**

- Advanced lifters may need higher end of range
- Higher volumes can target lagging muscle groups
- **Important**: Volume studies are muscle-specific; can't generalize high volumes (30+ sets) to all muscles simultaneously

### Intensity (Load)
| Goal | %1RM | Rep Range |
|------|------|-----------|
| Strength-focused | 80-100% | 1-5 |
| Hypertrophy-focused | 65-85% | 6-12 |
| Metabolic/endurance | 50-65% | 15-30+ |

*Note: Hypertrophy occurs across spectrum when sets taken close to failure*

### Frequency
**Per-session threshold: ~10 sets per muscle group** (diminishing value beyond)

| Weekly Sets/Muscle | Book Guidance |
|--------------------|---------------|
| Low (any amount) | Frequency doesn't matter much |
| >10 sets | At least 2x/week for better volume management |
| ~30 sets | At least 3x/week |

*"Frequency does not have much impact on muscle development; its primary utility is to act as a vehicle to manage weekly volume."*

### Rest Periods
| Goal | Rest Between Sets |
|------|-------------------|
| Strength | 3-5 min |
| Hypertrophy | 1-3 min |
| Metabolic stress | 30-60 sec |

### Key Principles
- Mechanical tension = primary hypertrophy driver
- Progressive overload = essential for continued gains
- Training to/near failure = important for maximizing recruitment
- Volume (10-20 sets/muscle/week) = primary modifiable variable for hypertrophy
- Per-session threshold ~10 sets/muscle = beyond this, spread across more sessions
- Individual variation = significant; adjust based on response
