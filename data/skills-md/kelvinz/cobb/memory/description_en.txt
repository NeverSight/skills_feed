Shared protocol for updating `tasks/memory.md` with durable project memory (project gist, key decisions, completed milestones, and important notes/gotchas). Use this guidance inside `new`/`plan`/`implement`/`review`/`commit` whenever durable information appears; use standalone only for explicit backfill/repair/cleanup requests. Triggers: memory, remember, add to memory, project notes, decision log.
