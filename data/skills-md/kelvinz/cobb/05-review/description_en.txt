Perform a structured review focused on correctness, security best practices, bugs, and edge cases. Review either a GitHub PR (preferred, via gh) or a local diff vs base when no PR exists. Update tracking: mark PRD as Reviewed when LGTM; if the PR is merged, mark Merged, rename PRD to done-*, and update tasks/todo.md status to ✅. Triggers: review, self review, code review, security review, edge cases, pre-merge, gh pr diff, gh pr checks.
