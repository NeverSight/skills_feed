Run a strict review in exactly one mode: GitHub PR (`pr`) or local diff (`local`). Use when validating correctness, security, tests, and scope before merge or commit. Output a mode-specific decision report: `Ready to accept PR` (pr mode) or `Good to commit` (local mode), require fixes when the decision is `No`, and capture durable review findings in `tasks/memory.md` when warranted.
