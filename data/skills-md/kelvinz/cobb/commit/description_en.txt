Create atomic commits with explicit user approval, using emoji-prefixed titles and `feat`/`fix`/`chore` commit types. Use when staging changes, proposing commit batches, writing high-signal commit messages in imperative mood, committing iteratively, finalising a feature branch by merging/closing/deleting it, and capturing durable memory updates during commit/finalise decisions.
