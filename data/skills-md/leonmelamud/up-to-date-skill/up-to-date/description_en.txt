Fetches and validates current third-party API documentation, checks SDK version compatibility, and verifies correct method signatures and parameter shapes before writing or debugging integration code. Use when writing, editing, or refactoring code that calls any third-party SDK, API, or library method; debugging issues where an API call succeeds but the expected side-effect doesn't happen; installing or importing external packages; or when something 'doesn't work' and the code involves an external service.
