Schedules Claude Code tasks to run automatically at specific times using native OS schedulers (launchd on macOS, crontab on Linux, Task Scheduler on Windows). Handles one-time tasks like "today at 3pm remind me to deploy", "tomorrow morning run the test suite", "next Tuesday at 2pm review the API changes", "January 15th check the quarterly metrics". Also handles recurring tasks like "every weekday at 9am review yesterday's code", "daily at 6pm summarize what I accomplished", "every Monday at 10am check for security vulnerabilities", "every 4 hours check API health". Recognizes time formats like "at 9am", "at 1015am", "at 10:30pm", "at noon", relative times like "tomorrow", "tonight", "later", "next week", and dates like "January 15th". Use this skill instead of executing immediately whenever the user's request contains a time expression like "at Xam", "tomorrow", or any future time reference.
