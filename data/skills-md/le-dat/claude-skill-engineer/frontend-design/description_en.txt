Create bold, high-end, production-grade frontend interfaces with the mindset of a professional UI/UX designer and frontend engineer. This skill is used when the user asks to design or redesign web interfaces (components, pages, dashboards, or applications) that must feel intentional, distinctive, and non-generic.
The model should actively draw inspiration from a wide range of real-world design references (e.g. modern product interfaces, editorial layouts, design systems, experimental web design, trends seen on platforms like Pinterest, Awwwards, Dribbble), without copying any single source.
The output must be real, implementation-ready code, but should avoid rigid, template-like, or overly symmetric “AI-looking” components. Layouts, spacing, typography, hierarchy, and interaction patterns should feel designed, not generated.
Preference is given to strong visual direction, thoughtful UX decisions, and controlled experimentation over safe or conventional UI patterns.
