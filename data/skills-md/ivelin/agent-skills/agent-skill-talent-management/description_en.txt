Discovers capabilities via skills.sh and GitHub, performs deep quality evaluations, checks for security risks (prompt injection), manages compatibility, and outputs human-readable recommendations + machine-parseable JSON actions. Integrates official skills CLI (`npx skills check` / `update`) for easy maintenance of installed skills.
