Analyze a codebase and generate comprehensive documentation including architecture, components, interfaces, workflows, and dependencies. Creates an AI-optimized knowledge base (index.md) and can consolidate into AGENTS.md, README.md, or CONTRIBUTING.md. Use when the user wants to document a codebase, create AGENTS.md, understand system architecture, generate developer documentation, or asks to "summarize the codebase".
