Guide for implementing James Shore's Nullables pattern and A-Frame architecture for testing without mocks. Use when implementing or refactoring code to follow patterns of: (1) Separating logic, infrastructure, and application layers, (2) Creating testable infrastructure with create/createNull factory methods, (3) Writing narrow, sociable, state-based tests without mocks, (4) Implementing value objects, (5) Building infrastructure wrappers that use embedded stubs, or (6) Designing dependency injection through static factory methods.
