Build sophisticated React animations with Motion (formerly Framer Motion) - declarative animations, gestures (drag, hover, tap), scroll effects, spring physics, layout animations, and SVG manipulation. Optimize bundle size with LazyMotion (4.6 KB) or useAnimate mini (2.3 KB).

Use when: adding drag-and-drop interactions, creating scroll-triggered animations, implementing modal dialogs with transitions, building carousels with momentum, animating page/route transitions, creating parallax hero sections, implementing accordions with smooth expand/collapse, or optimizing animation bundle sizes. For simple list animations, use auto-animate skill instead (3.28 KB vs 34 KB).

Troubleshoot: AnimatePresence exit not working, large list performance issues, Tailwind transition conflicts, Next.js "use client" errors, scrollable container layout issues, or Cloudflare Workers build errors (resolved Dec 2024).
