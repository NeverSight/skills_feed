Set up and maintain Gmail Multiple Inboxes with auto-discovered sender filters. Scans the user's Gmail to discover senders, suggests inbox categories, generates a Google Apps Script that creates labels and filters. Use this skill for: organizing Gmail, setting up multiple inboxes, managing Gmail labels and filters, categorizing email senders, updating inbox filters with new senders, or unsubscribing from noisy emails. Trigger phrases: "Gmail sections", "inbox categories", "email organization", "sender filters", "multiple inboxes", "clean up my inbox".
