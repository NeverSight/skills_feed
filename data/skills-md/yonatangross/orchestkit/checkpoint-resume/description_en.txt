Rate-limit-resilient pipeline with checkpoint/resume for long multi-phase sessions. Saves progress to .claude/pipeline-state.json after each phase. Use when starting a complex multi-phase task that risks hitting rate limits, when resuming an interrupted session, or when orchestrating work spanning commits, GitHub issues, and large file changes.
