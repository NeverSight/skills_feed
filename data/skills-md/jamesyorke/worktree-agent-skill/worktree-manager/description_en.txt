Git worktree management with safe defaults and flexible placement strategies. Use when users ask to: (1) create a new worktree or work on multiple branches in parallel, (2) list existing worktrees, (3) remove or clean up worktrees, (4) manage worktree placement (subfolder vs sibling directory), or any other git worktree operations.
