Comprehensive Solidity smart contract security auditing and vulnerability analysis skill. Based on methodologies from Trail of Bits, OpenZeppelin, Consensys Diligence, Sherlock, CertiK, Cyfrin, Spearbit, Halborn, and other leading Web3 security firms. This skill should be used whenever the user asks to "audit a smart contract", "review Solidity code for security", "find vulnerabilities", "check for reentrancy", "analyze gas optimization", "review access control", "check proxy patterns", "analyze DeFi protocol security", "review ERC20/ERC721 implementation", "check oracle manipulation risks", "review upgrade patterns", or mentions any security review of EVM-compatible smart contracts. Also triggers for keywords like "slither", "echidna", "foundry fuzz", "formal verification", "invariant testing", "flash loan attack", "MEV", "sandwich attack", "front-running", "delegatecall", "selfdestruct", "reentrancy guard", "access control vulnerability", "storage collision", "proxy upgrade security", "smart contract exploit", "L2 security", "cross-chain", "bridge security", "sequencer", "LayerZero", "CCIP", "account abstraction", "ERC-4337", "smart account", "paymaster", "bundler", "UserOperation", "re-audit", "diff audit", "remediation review", "fix verification", "Uniswap v4 hooks", "Chainlink integration", "Aave integration", "flash loan receiver", "ERC-4626 vault", "restaking", "EigenLayer", "severity classification", "severity decision". Even if the user simply pastes Solidity code and asks "is this safe?" or "any issues here?", use this skill.
