Generate, debug, and optimize Kestra workflow orchestration YAML files. Kestra is an open-source, declarative data orchestration platform using YAML syntax.

Use this skill when:
- Creating new Kestra flows (workflows)
- Debugging or fixing existing Kestra YAML
- Adding triggers (schedule, webhook, flow-based)
- Implementing error handling, retries, or timeouts
- Writing script tasks (Python, Shell, Node.js, etc.)
- Building parallel or conditional workflows
- Converting from Airflow/Prefect to Kestra
- Any question about Kestra syntax, plugins, or best practices
