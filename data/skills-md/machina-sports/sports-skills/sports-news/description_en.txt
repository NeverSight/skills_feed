Sports news via RSS/Atom feeds and Google News. Fetch headlines, search by query, filter by date. Covers football news, transfer rumors, match reports, and any sport via Google News.

Use when: user asks for recent news, headlines, transfer rumors, or articles about any sport. Good for "what's the latest on [team/player]" questions. Supports any Google News query and curated RSS feeds (BBC Sport, ESPN, The Athletic, Sky Sports).
Don't use when: user asks for structured data like standings, scores, statistics, or xG — use football-data instead. Don't use for prediction market odds — use polymarket or kalshi. Don't use for F1 timing data — use fastf1. News results are text articles, not structured data.
