Use when: user asks about sports betting odds, prediction markets, win probabilities, market sentiment, or "who is favored to win" questions.
Don't use when: user asks about actual match results, scores, or statistics — use football-data or fastf1 instead. Don't use for historical match data. Don't use for news — use sports-news instead. Don't confuse with Kalshi — Polymarket focuses on crypto-native prediction markets with deeper sports coverage; Kalshi is a US-regulated exchange with different market structure.
