Manage Flare error tracking and performance monitoring using the flare CLI. Use when the user wants to list, triage, resolve, snooze, or debug errors; manage projects; create projects and retrieve API keys; check error counts; investigate slow routes, queries, jobs, or commands; view aggregated performance data and traces; or interact with flareapp.io from the command line.
