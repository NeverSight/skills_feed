PostgreSQL-based semantic and hybrid search with pgvector and ParadeDB.
Use when implementing vector search, semantic search, hybrid search,
or full-text search in PostgreSQL. Covers pgvector setup, indexing
(HNSW, IVFFlat), hybrid search (FTS + BM25 + RRF), ParadeDB as
Elasticsearch alternative, and re-ranking with Cohere/cross-encoders.
Supports vector(1536) and halfvec(3072) types for OpenAI embeddings.

Triggers: pgvector, vector search, semantic search, hybrid search,
embedding search, PostgreSQL RAG, BM25, RRF, HNSW index, similarity search,
ParadeDB, pg_search, reranking, Cohere rerank
