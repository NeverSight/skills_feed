Enable efficient communication between Thai-language users and agents by translating Thai prompts into English in two modes and by preventing Thai text corruption in files. Use when the user writes in Thai, asks for Thai-to-English interpretation, wants token-efficient prompt rewriting, or reports mojibake/replacement-character issues such as U+FFFD in saved files.
