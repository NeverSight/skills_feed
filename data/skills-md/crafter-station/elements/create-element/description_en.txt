Create new UI elements for tryelements.dev registry. Use when: (1) Adding new UI components (buttons, inputs, cards), (2) Building integration components (Clerk, Stripe, Uploadthing), (3) Creating theme-related elements, (4) Any shadcn-style registry component. IMPORTANT: For logo components with variants (icon/wordmark/logo + dark/light), use the logo-with-variants skill instead. This skill includes scaffolding, registry schema, and component patterns. ALWAYS use Context7 MCP to fetch latest dependency docs before implementing.
