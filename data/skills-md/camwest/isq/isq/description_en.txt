Use the isq CLI for instant, offline-first GitHub, Linear, and JIRA issue management. Use this skill when the user wants to list issues, create issues, comment on issues, start working on an issue (creates git worktree), manage goals (milestones/projects), sync repositories, or work with issues offline. isq provides sub-millisecond reads from a local SQLite cache and integrates with git worktrees for seamless development workflows.
