Anti-detection browser automation using Camoufox (Firefox fork with C++ fingerprint spoofing). Use when standard browser tools get blocked by Cloudflare, Akamai, or bot detection. Triggers include "stealth browse", "anti-detection", "bypass bot", "camofox", "blocked by Cloudflare", scraping protected sites (X/Twitter, Amazon, Product Hunt), or when agent-browser/playwright fails with bot detection errors.
