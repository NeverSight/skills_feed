description: Enforce project code standards when writing code
---

## Workflow

1. Determine the language of the code being written or reviewed
2. Read the relevant standards file from `languages/` (e.g., `languages/ts.md` for TypeScript)
3. Read the relevant standards from `frameworks/` (e.g., `frameworks/tailwind.md` for Tailwind)`
4. Apply all standards when writing new code or reviewing existing code
5. When reviewing, flag violations with the specific rule and a suggested fix

## Supported languages

- **TypeScript / TSX**: See [languages/ts.md](languages/ts.md) for all rules

## Supported frameworks 

- **Tailwind**: See [frameworks/tailwind.md](frameworks/tailwind.md) for all rules

## Supported templating languages

- **JSX/TSX**: See [templating/jsx.md](templating/jsx.md) for all rules
