Create atomic git commits with heuristic analysis, conventional-commit formatting, staging rules, optional deep analysis, and optional push. Use when the user asks to craft a commit message, commit changes, stage/commit only session edits, or run a commit workflow with flags like --all, --deep, or --push.
