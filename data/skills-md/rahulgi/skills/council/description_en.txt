Consult an advisory council of three AI personas — Cato (skeptic), Ada (optimist), Marcus (pragmatist) — backed by different frontier LLM agents (Gemini, Claude, Codex). Each persona runs as a separate agent process with full repo context and returns independent feedback. Use when the user says "/council", asks for a second opinion, wants feedback on code changes, needs a premortem, wants to pressure-test a decision, or asks "what do you think about this approach?" Claude may also proactively suggest consulting the council before major architectural decisions, risky deploys, or ambiguous trade-offs (but should ask for user approval first).
