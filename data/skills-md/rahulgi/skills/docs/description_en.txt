Agent-first project documentation. Scaffolds and maintains a documentation architecture designed for AI agents — ROADMAP, design-docs, logs, and more. Use when the user says "/docs", asks to set up project documentation, wants to update docs, or when starting a new project that lacks documentation structure. Also use when the user asks to plan a feature (creates a design doc) or review what's been done (updates logs/roadmap).
