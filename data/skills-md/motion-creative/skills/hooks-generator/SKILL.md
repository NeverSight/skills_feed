# Hooks Generator

This skill helps you discover and brainstorm psychologically compelling hooks for paid social advertising. A great hook creates instant audience recognition—the moment where viewers feel seen or exposed.

## Companion Skills

| Task | Use Instead |
|------|-------------|
| Developing hooks into full ad concepts | **ad-concept-generator** |
| Writing UGC scripts from concepts | **ugc-scriptwriter** |

## Quick Start (Minimal Input)

Need hooks fast? Provide just these two things:

1. **What you're selling** (product/service in one sentence)
2. **Who it's for** (specific audience)

Claude will generate 3-5 hook directions immediately based on common psychological tensions for that audience.

**Note:** Quick Start produces solid directions. Full Discovery (below) produces *sharper* hooks because it uncovers your audience's specific emotional landscape.

## What Good Looks Like

Before diving into the process, here's an example of a strong hook:

**Product:** Noise-canceling headphones for remote workers

**Weak hook:** "Block out distractions and focus better" *(benefit statement, generic)*

**Strong hook:** "You've reread that same paragraph 4 times"

**Why it works:**
- **Identity-level:** Speaks to the frustrated remote worker, not generic "professionals"
- **Specific:** Names a concrete moment (rereading), not abstract "distraction"
- **Lived truth:** Anyone who's struggled to focus has experienced this exact moment
- **Emotionally charged:** Hits the nerve of frustration and self-disappointment

The viewer doesn't think "that's a nice ad." They think "wait, that's literally me right now."

## 1. Discovery: Understanding the Brand & Audience

Before brainstorming hooks, gather essential context.

### Required Information

| Required | Question to Ask | Why It Matters |
|----------|-----------------|----------------|
| Product/Service | "What are you selling?" | Hooks must connect to real product truths |
| Target Audience | "Who is this for? Be specific." | Identity-level hooks require knowing the identity |
| Core Problem | "What problem does this solve?" | Tension comes from unresolved problems |
| Emotional Reality | "How does the audience *feel* about this problem?" | Hooks hit emotions, not logic |

### Deeper Discovery (If Initial Answers Are Vague)

| Probe | What You're Looking For |
|-------|------------------------|
| "What does your audience complain about in reviews or comments?" | Real language, real frustrations |
| "What do competitors get wrong that frustrates people?" | Unmet needs, silent pain points |
| "What's embarrassing or annoying about the status quo?" | Identity-level tensions |
| "What do people secretly think but rarely say?" | Psychological truths |

**Do not proceed until you have clear answers to the required questions.**

## 2. What Makes a Hook Psychologically Compelling

### The Core Principle

A strong hook is NOT a benefit statement, tagline, or clever wordplay.

It's the line that makes viewers think:
- "Oh shit, that's me."
- "That's exactly my problem."
- "Are they in my head?"

### Characteristics of Strong Hooks

| Characteristic | Description |
|----------------|-------------|
| **Identity-Level** | Speaks to who the person IS, not just what they want |
| **Specific** | Names a concrete behavior, moment, or feeling |
| **Lived Truth** | Reflects something real the audience has experienced |
| **Disruptive** | Interrupts the scroll by creating recognition |
| **Emotionally Charged** | Hits a nerve—frustration, shame, desire, fear |

### Sources of Psychological Tension

Strong hooks often come from:
- Daily annoyances the audience tolerates
- Embarrassing habits they don't talk about
- Silent frustrations with existing solutions
- Identity beliefs they hold about themselves
- Self-awareness moments ("I know I shouldn't, but...")
- Fears they haven't articulated

---

## 3. Ideation Workflow

### Step 1: Map the Emotional Landscape

Based on discovery, identify:

```
What does the audience...
├── Secretly struggle with?
├── Feel embarrassed about?
├── Wish they could admit?
├── Get frustrated by repeatedly?
└── Believe about themselves (good or bad)?
```

### Step 2: Brainstorm Hook Directions

Generate 5-10 *directions* (not final hooks) based on the emotional landscape:

| Direction Type | Example Frame |
|----------------|---------------|
| Confession | "I used to [embarrassing behavior]..." |
| Called Out | "You're the person who [specific habit]..." |
| Recognition | "When you [specific moment], you know..." |
| Insider Truth | "Nobody talks about [hidden reality]..." |
| Identity Claim | "If you're someone who [identity trait]..." |

### Step 3: Sharpen Into Hook Candidates

For each promising direction:
1. Make it shorter (aim for 1-10 words)
2. Make it more specific
3. Remove anything generic
4. Test: "Would someone say 'that's me'?"

### Step 4: Evaluate Hook Strength

For each candidate, assess:

| Criteria | Question |
|----------|----------|
| Recognition | Would the target audience feel instantly seen? |
| Specificity | Is this concrete enough to feel real? |
| Tension | Does it touch something unresolved or uncomfortable? |
| Authenticity | Does it sound like something a real person would say/think? |

## 4. Common Pitfalls

| Pitfall | Problem | Fix |
|---------|---------|-----|
| Too generic | "Feel your best" | Name the specific feeling or behavior |
| Benefit-focused | "Get more energy" | Start with the problem, not the solution |
| Too clever | Puns, wordplay | Clarity over cleverness |
| Not audience-specific | Could apply to anyone | Narrow to the specific identity |
| Exaggerated | Beyond what audience experiences | Ground in real, lived truth |

---

## 5. Output: Hook Directions

After completing the workflow, provide:
- 5-10 hook directions with brief rationale for each
- Assessment of which directions have highest psychological tension
- Recommendations for which to develop further

## Troubleshooting

| Issue | Cause | Solution |
|-------|-------|----------|
| Hooks feel generic | Insufficient audience understanding | Return to discovery, dig deeper on emotional reality |
| Can't find tension | Problem isn't painful enough | Explore adjacent frustrations or deeper identity beliefs |
| Hooks too long | Trying to explain too much | Cut to the single most charged element |
