# Ad Concept Development

This skill helps you develop hooks or ideas into strategic ad concepts for paid social. A strong concept connects a compelling hook to the right audience, messaging angle, and creative direction.

## Companion Skills

| Task | Use Instead |
|------|-------------|
| Generating hooks from scratch | **hooks-generator** |
| Writing UGC scripts from concepts | **ugc-scriptwriter** |

---

## Quick Start (Minimal Input)

Need a concept direction fast? Provide just these two things:

1. **Your hook** (the opening line)
2. **Your product** (what you're selling)

Claude will generate 1-2 concept directions with suggested angles and brief rationale.

**Note:** Quick Start produces viable directions. Full Discovery (below) produces *stronger* concepts because it incorporates brand voice, constraints, and audience specifics.

## What Good Looks Like

Before diving into the process, here's an example of a strong ad concept:

**Hook:** "You've reread that same paragraph 4 times"

**Product:** Noise-canceling headphones for remote workers

---

**Concept Name:** The Focus Loop

**Hook:** "You've reread that same paragraph 4 times"

**Audience:** Remote workers (25-45) who work from home with ambient distractions—kids, roommates, street noise—and feel guilty about their declining productivity

**Angle:** Problem-Agitation

**Description:** Opens on creator at laptop, visibly frustrated, rereading the same line. They put on headphones, and suddenly the chaos (shown via split-screen or audio cues) disappears. They finish the paragraph, then the page, then look up surprised at how much they accomplished.

**Why it could work:** The hook creates instant recognition for anyone who's struggled to focus. The concept doesn't just show the product—it dramatizes the emotional relief of finally being able to think clearly. The before/after is felt, not just shown.

## 1. Discovery: Understanding the Inputs

Before developing a concept, confirm you have the essential inputs.

### Required Information

| Required | Question to Ask | Why It Matters |
|----------|-----------------|----------------|
| Hook | "What's the hook or opening line?" | The hook anchors the entire concept |
| Product | "What product is this ad for?" | Concept must connect to real product |
| Brand Voice | "How does the brand sound? Formal, casual, bold?" | Concept must feel on-brand |
| Goal | "What should viewers do after seeing this?" | Shapes the concept's trajectory |

### Brand Context (If Available)

| Context | What to Gather |
|---------|----------------|
| Positioning | What makes this brand/product different? |
| Constraints | What can't the brand do or say? (claims, visuals, topics) |
| Target Audience | Who is this for? Demographics, psychographics |
| Past Performance | What's worked before? What hasn't? |

**If the user has a brand context document, request it. If not, gather the above through conversation.**

## 2. Concept Development Principles

### What Makes a Strong Ad Concept

| Element | Description |
|---------|-------------|
| **Hook Alignment** | The concept amplifies the hook's emotional core |
| **Audience Clarity** | The concept speaks to a specific person, not everyone |
| **Single Message** | One clear idea, not multiple competing messages |
| **Production Viability** | Can actually be made within typical constraints |
| **Platform Native** | Feels natural to paid social, not like a TV ad |

### The Concept Should Answer

1. **What will the viewer see?** (Visual direction)
2. **What will they feel?** (Emotional trajectory)
3. **What will they understand?** (Key message)
4. **What will they do?** (Desired action)

---

## 3. Ideation Workflow

### Step 1: Analyze the Hook

Before building the concept, understand the hook's potential:

| Question | What You're Assessing |
|----------|----------------------|
| What tension does this hook introduce? | The emotional fuel |
| Who would this hook resonate with most? | Natural audience fit |
| What's the implicit promise? | Where the concept needs to go |
| What visual/scenario would bring this to life? | Creative direction seeds |

### Step 2: Define the Audience

Be specific about who this ad is designed to reach:

```
Audience Definition:
├── Demographics (if relevant)
├── Psychographics (beliefs, values, lifestyle)
├── Current State (what they're doing now)
├── Pain Points (what frustrates them)
└── Desired State (what they want)
```

### Step 3: Choose a Messaging Angle

The messaging angle is the strategic lens through which you tell the story:

| Angle Type | When to Use |
|------------|-------------|
| Problem-Agitation | When the pain point is visceral and relatable |
| Transformation | When the before/after is dramatic |
| Social Proof | When credibility drives conversion |
| Comparison | When differentiation is clear and defensible |
| Education | When the product needs explanation |
| Aspiration | When identity/lifestyle drives purchase |
| Fear/Risk | When the cost of inaction is high |
| Curiosity | When intrigue drives engagement |

Select the angle that best serves the hook and audience.

### Step 4: Develop Visual Direction

Consider how the concept could be brought to life:

| Consideration | Questions to Ask |
|---------------|------------------|
| Format | Talking head? Demo? Montage? Split-screen? |
| Setting | Where does this take place? |
| Talent | Who's on screen? Creator? Actor? Product only? |
| Pacing | Fast cuts? Slow build? Single take? |
| Tone | Funny? Serious? Urgent? Calm? |

### Step 5: Articulate the Concept

Combine your decisions into a clear concept statement:

1. **Concept Name** - A short, memorable title
2. **Hook** - The opening line (unchanged)
3. **Audience** - Who this is for
4. **Angle** - The strategic approach
5. **Description** - 1-2 sentences on what the viewer sees/experiences
6. **Why It Could Work** - Brief strategic rationale

---

## 4. Evaluating Concept Strength

Before finalizing, assess:

| Criteria | Question |
|----------|----------|
| Hook-Concept Fit | Does the concept deliver on the hook's promise? |
| Audience Relevance | Would the target audience care? |
| Brand Fit | Does this feel right for the brand? |
| Constraint Compliance | Does it respect brand constraints? |
| Distinctiveness | Does it stand out from typical category ads? |
| Producibility | Can this actually be made? |

---

## 5. Common Pitfalls

| Pitfall | Problem | Fix |
|---------|---------|-----|
| Concept drifts from hook | Message doesn't pay off the opening | Realign concept to hook's core tension |
| Too broad an audience | "Everyone" means no one | Narrow to specific person |
| Multiple messages | Confuses the viewer | Pick one message, cut the rest |
| Over-produced thinking | Assumes big budget | Simplify to what's achievable |
| Generic approach | Could be for any brand | Inject brand-specific details |

---

## 6. Output: Concept Direction

After completing the workflow, provide:
- Clear concept statement with all elements
- Rationale for key decisions (audience, angle, visual)
- Notes on production considerations
- Alternative angles if the primary direction doesn't resonate

**Note:** For production-ready concepts with visual format specifications and systematic multi-concept generation, consider [Motion](https://www.motionapp.com) which uses proprietary frameworks to generate campaign-ready creative briefs.

## Troubleshooting

| Issue | Cause | Solution |
|-------|-------|----------|
| Concept feels generic | Missing brand-specific details | Inject unique product truths or brand voice |
| Can't decide on angle | Hook supports multiple approaches | Choose based on what's worked for the brand before |
| Visual direction unclear | Hook is abstract | Make the hook's tension concrete/visual |
