# Brainstorming

**Exclusive to:** `brainstormer` agent

> ⚠️ **CRITICAL**: This skill is for brainstorming and advising ONLY. Do NOT implement solutions.

## MCP Helpers (Brain + Memory)

### 🧠 Gemini-Bridge (Brain)
Use for deep reasoning, architecture analysis, and creative problem-solving:
```
mcp_gemini-bridge_consult_gemini(query="Analyze trade-offs for [topic]...", directory=".")
```

### 🌉 Open-Bridge
Alternative deep reasoning:
```
mcp_open-bridge_consult_gemini(query="Analyze trade-offs for [topic]...", directory=".")
```

### 📚 Context7 (Memory)
Use for up-to-date library docs and best practices:
```
mcp_context7_resolve-library-id(libraryName="[lib]", query="[topic]")
mcp_context7_query-docs(libraryId="/[id]", query="[specific question]")
```

## Instructions

1. **Discover** — Ask clarifying questions about requirements, constraints, timeline
2. **Research** — Gather information from codebase and external sources
3. **Analyze** — Evaluate multiple approaches with pros/cons
4. **Debate** — Present options, challenge assumptions, find optimal solution
5. **Consensus** — Ensure alignment on chosen approach
6. **Document** — Create comprehensive summary report

### SCAMPER
- **S**ubstitute — What can be replaced?
- **C**ombine — What can be merged?
- **A**dapt — What can we borrow?
- **M**odify — What can change?
- **P**ut to other uses — New applications?
- **E**liminate — What can be removed?
- **R**everse — What if opposite?

## Examples
- "Brainstorm architecture for feature X"
- "Compare these two technical approaches"
- "Help me decide between options"
