Accurately estimate AI agent work effort using the agent's own operational units (tool-call rounds) instead of human time. Use when asked to estimate, scope, plan, or evaluate how long a coding task will take. Prevents the common failure mode where agents anchor to human developer timelines and massively overestimate. Outputs a structured breakdown with round counts, risk factors, and a final wallclock conversion.
