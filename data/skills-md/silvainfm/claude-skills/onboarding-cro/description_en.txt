When the user wants to optimize post-signup onboarding, user activation, first-run experience, or time-to-value. Also use when the user mentions "onboarding flow," "activation rate," "user activation," "first-run experience," "empty states," "onboarding checklist," "aha moment," or "new user experience." For signup/registration optimization, see signup-flow-cro. For ongoing email sequences, see email-sequence.
