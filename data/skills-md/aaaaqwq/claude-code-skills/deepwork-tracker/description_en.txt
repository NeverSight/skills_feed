Track deep work sessions locally (start/stop/status) and generate a GitHub-contribution-graph style minutes-per-day heatmap for sharing (e.g., via Telegram). Use when the user says things like “start deep work”, “stop deep work”, “am I in a session?”, “show my deep work graph”, or asks to review deep work history.
