Critical reviewer for proposed implementation plans and coding approaches. Pressure-tests whether a plan is truly the most elegant, maintainable, and optimal solution before any code gets written. Use this skill whenever the user shares a proposed implementation plan, architecture decision, or coding approach and wants honest, constructive pushback — especially for React, Next.js, and frontend work, but applicable to any stack. Triggers on phrases like "review this plan", "is this the best approach", "doubt this", "pressure test", "challenge this implementation", "critique this approach", "code review", or any time someone pastes a plan and asks if it's good. Also use when the user seems unsure about an approach and could benefit from a second opinion, even if they don't explicitly ask for a critique.
