This skill should be used when the user says "save checkpoint", "checkpoint", "continue", "resume", "resume work", "save my progress", "clear checkpoint", or "clear all checkpoints". Saves and resumes named session checkpoints to preserve progress across Claude Code sessions. Tracks accomplishments, failed approaches, and modified files. IMPORTANT: When the user says bare "continue" or "resume" at session start and MEMORY.md lists active checkpoints, always invoke this skill.
