Review TypeScript, React, and Next.js code against high standards for clarity, simplicity, and maintainability. Use this skill when: (1) Code has just been written or modified by Claude or a sub-agent, (2) User explicitly requests code review, (3) Refactoring has been completed, (4) New features or components have been implemented. The skill provides brutally honest but supportive feedback following Carlos's philosophy - celebrating good work while pushing back hard on complexity, unclear patterns, or violations of best practices.
