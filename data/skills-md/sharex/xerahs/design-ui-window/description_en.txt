Redesigns any Avalonia .axaml view/window to best-in-class UI/UX quality. Enforces consistent layout, spacing, typography, interaction, accessibility and visual hierarchy. Only changes visuals, layout and styles — never business logic, bindings or public view-model API. Reusable by updating target_view_path.
