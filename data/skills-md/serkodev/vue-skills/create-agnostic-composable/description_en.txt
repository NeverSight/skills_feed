Create a library-grade Vue composable that accepts maybe-reactive inputs (MaybeRef / MaybeRefOrGetter) so callers can pass a plain value, ref, or getter. Normalize inputs with toValue()/toRef() inside reactive effects (watch/watchEffect) to keep behavior predictable and reactive. Use this skill when user asks for creating agnostic or reusable composables.
