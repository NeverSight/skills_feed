}'
```

**Required:**

**Optional:**

- `first_sentence` — specific opening line
- `voice` — voice preset (see Voice Options below)
- `max_duration` — max call length in minutes (1-30, default 5)
- `wait_for_greeting` — wait for recipient to speak first (default false)
- `record` — record call audio (default true)
- `model` — `"base"` (default, best quality) or `"turbo"` (lowest latency)
- `transfer_phone_number` — number to transfer to if caller requests a human
- `voicemail_action` — `"hangup"` (default), `"leave_message"`, or `"ignore"`
- `voicemail_message` — message to leave (required when action is `"leave_message"`)
- `metadata` — custom key-value data to attach

## Check Call Status

Poll until `completed` is true:

```bash
npx agentcash fetch https://stablephone.dev/api/call/{call_id}
```

**Response fields:**

```

**Optional:**
- `area_code` — 3-digit US/CA area code (random if omitted)

```

Extends by 30 days from current expiry. Top-ups stack. Anyone can top up any number.

## List Your Numbers

```bash
npx agentcash fetch https://stablephone.dev/api/numbers?wallet=YOUR_WALLET_ADDRESS
```

## Workflows

### Quick Call

- [ ] (Optional) Check balance: `npx agentcash wallet info`
- [ ] Make call with task instructions
- [ ] Poll status until completed
- [ ] Review transcript and summary

```bash
npx agentcash fetch https://stablephone.dev/api/call -m POST -b '{
  "phone_number": "+14155551234",
  "task": "Ask if the business is open on weekends and what their hours are."
}'
```

### Leave a Voicemail

```bash
npx agentcash fetch https://stablephone.dev/api/call -m POST -b '{
  "phone_number": "+14155551234",
  "task": "Leave a voicemail about the appointment.",
  "voicemail_action": "leave_message",
  "voicemail_message": "Hi, this is a reminder about your appointment tomorrow at 3pm. Please call back to confirm."
}'
```

For natural voicemail delivery, use `"voicemail_action": "ignore"` which bypasses detection and lets the AI speak naturally into the voicemail system.

### Call with Transfer

```bash
npx agentcash fetch https://stablephone.dev/api/call -m POST -b '{
  "phone_number": "+14155551234",
  "task": "Qualify this lead. Ask about their budget and timeline. If they are interested, offer to transfer to a sales rep.",
  "transfer_phone_number": "+14155559999",
  "voice": "josh",
  "max_duration": 10
}'
```

### Set Up Dedicated Number

- [ ] Buy a phone number ($20)
- [ ] Use it as caller ID for outbound calls
- [ ] Top up before expiry ($15/30 days)

```bash
npx agentcash fetch https://stablephone.dev/api/number -m POST -b '{"area_code": "212", "country_code": "US"}'
```

Then use it as `from`:

```bash
npx agentcash fetch https://stablephone.dev/api/call -m POST -b '{
  "phone_number": "+14155551234",
  "from": "+12125551234",
  "task": "Confirm the reservation for Friday at 7pm."
}'
```

## Cost Estimation

| Task | Cost |
|------|------|
| Single call | $0.54 |
| Call + dedicated number | $20.54 |
| Monthly number maintenance | $15.00 |
| 10 calls/month + number | $20.00 + $5.40 = $25.40 first month |
