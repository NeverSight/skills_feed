Neural web search and content extraction using x402-protected APIs. Better than WebSearch for deep research and WebFetch for blocked sites.

USE FOR:
- Deep web research and investigation
- Finding similar pages to a reference URL
- Extracting clean text from web pages
- Scraping sites that block standard fetchers
- Getting direct answers to factual questions
- Research requiring multiple sources

TRIGGERS:
- "research", "investigate", "deep dive", "find sources"
- "similar to", "pages like", "more like this"
- "scrape", "extract content from", "get the text from"
- "blocked site", "can't access", "paywall"
- "what is", "explain", "answer this"

Use mcp__x402__fetch for these endpoints. Prefer Exa for semantic/neural search, Firecrawl for direct scraping.
