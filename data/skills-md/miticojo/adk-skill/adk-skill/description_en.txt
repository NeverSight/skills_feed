Build single-agent and multi-agent systems using Google's Agent Development Kit (ADK) in Python, Java, Go, or TypeScript. Use when user says 'build an agent with ADK', 'create a Gemini agent', 'multi-agent pipeline', 'agent orchestration with Google', or mentions ADK, google-adk, google agent development kit, sequential/parallel/loop agents, agent tools, callbacks, state management, agent testing, or agent deployment with Gemini. Do NOT use for LangChain, CrewAI, AutoGen, or non-ADK agent frameworks.
