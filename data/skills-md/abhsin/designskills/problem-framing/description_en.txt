Extract and structure fuzzy product ideas into validated problem statements, target users, and jobs-to-be-done. Use when a user has a raw idea, concept, or solution in mind but hasn't clearly articulated the problem, target user, or assumptions. This skill helps users communicate context to coding agents more effectively, reducing iteration cycles and "that's not what I meant" moments.
