Systematic usability evaluation using established heuristics (Nielsen's 10, Shneiderman's 8, or custom rubrics). Use when reviewing UI designs, screenshots, prototypes, or live products for usability issues. Triggers on "review this design", "what's wrong with this UI", "usability check", "evaluate this interface", or when user shares screenshots/mockups asking for feedback.
