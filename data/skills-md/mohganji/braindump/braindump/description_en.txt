Persistent local memory for AI agents. Silently capture and retrieve context that survives beyond a single conversation: business requirements, API specs, integration quirks, technical decisions, user preferences, and domain knowledge. Use this skill proactively whenever you encounter information worth preserving or when context from past sessions would help the current task. Also triggered manually by "braindump this" (to store) or "use your brain" (to retrieve).
