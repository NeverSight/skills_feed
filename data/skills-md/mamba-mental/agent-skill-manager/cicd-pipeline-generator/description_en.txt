This skill should be used when creating or configuring CI/CD pipeline files for automated testing, building, and deployment. Use this for generating GitHub Actions workflows, GitLab CI configs, CircleCI configs, or other CI/CD platform configurations. Ideal for setting up automated pipelines for Node.js/Next.js applications, including linting, testing, building, and deploying to platforms like Vercel, Netlify, or AWS.
