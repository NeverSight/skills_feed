Expert integration for the Serena MCP Server - a powerful coding agent toolkit providing IDE-like semantic code understanding to LLMs. This skill should be used when working with codebases through Serena tools, setting up Serena projects, performing semantic code navigation and editing, managing project memories, debugging complex automation workflows, or integrating Serena with Claude Desktop, Claude Code, Codex, ChatGPT, or custom agents. Triggers on Serena tool usage, project activation/onboarding, symbolic code operations (find_symbol, replace_symbol_body, etc.), memory management (write_memory, read_memory), and MCP server configuration. Use for large/complex codebases requiring structural understanding, refactoring tasks, and token-efficient code operations.
