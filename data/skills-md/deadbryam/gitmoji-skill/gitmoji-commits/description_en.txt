Create high-quality git commits with semantic gitmoji emojis. Automatically suggests appropriate gitmojis for commit types, review/stage intended changes, split into logical commits, and write clear conventional commit messages. Use when the user asks to commit, wants gitmoji-enhanced messages, needs to stage changes, or split work into multiple commits.
