Drizzle ORM best practices for TypeScript projects using PostgreSQL. Use this skill when writing, reviewing, or optimizing Drizzle ORM schemas, queries, relations, migrations, or database configurations targeting Postgres. Apply these guidelines whenever you see drizzle-orm imports, pgTable definitions, drizzle-kit config files, or relational query patterns. Also use when setting up a new project with Drizzle + Postgres, migrating from another ORM, or troubleshooting type errors in Drizzle schemas.
