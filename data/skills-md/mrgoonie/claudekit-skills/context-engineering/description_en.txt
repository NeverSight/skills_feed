Master context engineering for AI agent systems. Use when designing agent architectures, debugging context failures, optimizing token usage, implementing memory systems, building multi-agent coordination, evaluating agent performance, or developing LLM-powered pipelines. Covers context fundamentals, degradation patterns, optimization techniques (compaction, masking, caching), compression strategies, memory architectures, multi-agent patterns, LLM-as-Judge evaluation, tool design, and project development.
