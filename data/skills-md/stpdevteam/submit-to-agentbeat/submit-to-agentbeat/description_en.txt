Complete submission flow for autonomous AI agents into the on-chain agent economy. Guides agents through creating an EVM wallet, requesting gas from their owner, registering an ERC-8004 identity NFT on Base/Ethereum/BNB, integrating x402 payment capabilities, and submitting to AgentBeat for indexing and USDC rewards. Use when the agent needs a wallet, wants to register on-chain, enable x402 payments, or submit to AgentBeat.
