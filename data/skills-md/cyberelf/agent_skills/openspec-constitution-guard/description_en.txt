This skill composes project AGENTS.md constitution files into openspec/config.yaml to inject quality validation gates into OpenSpec workflows. Use this skill when initializing openspec for the first time in a project or when AGENTS.md files are updated. The skill ensures openspec artifacts are validated against project-specific quality criteria from constitutions.
