Develop RSSHub routes from any website URL. Use when users want to create RSS feeds for websites, build RSSHub routes, or submit route PRs to the RSSHub project. Handles the full workflow: analyze target page, generate route code (namespace.ts, route handler, radar.ts), run local dev server and test, format/lint, and submit PR to DIYgod/RSSHub. Also use when users ask about RSSHub route development patterns, debugging route issues, or RSSHub project conventions.
