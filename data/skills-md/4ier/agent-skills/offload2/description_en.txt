Cognitive pressure release valve for agent execution. Use when internal reasoning state cannot be carried forward productively - conflicting assumptions, high reasoning pressure, or risk of compounding errors. Invoke to explicitly let go of unproductive internal state. This is a one-way, non-blocking, deliberately unreliable sink. The agent must behave identically whether offload succeeds or fails.
