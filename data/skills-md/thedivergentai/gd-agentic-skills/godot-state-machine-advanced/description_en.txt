Expert blueprint for hierarchical finite state machines (HSM) and pushdown automata for complex AI/character behaviors. Covers state stacks, sub-states, transition validation, and state context passing. Use when basic FSMs are insufficient OR implementing layered AI. Keywords state machine, HSM, hierarchical, pushdown automata, state stack, FSM, AI behavior.
