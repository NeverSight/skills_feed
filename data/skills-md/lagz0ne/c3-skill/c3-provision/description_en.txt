Documents architecture WITHOUT implementation. Creates ADR and component docs with status: provisioned.

MUST use this skill when user wants to DESIGN or PLAN without implementing:
- "provision X", "provision a component", "provision new service"
- "design the architecture for X", "design a component"
- "plan X", "plan a new service", "plan the architecture"
- "document X architecture", "architect X"
- "envision X", "sketch X architecture"

DO NOT use this skill if prompt contains:
- "pattern", "patterns" → route to c3-ref
- "ref", "refs" → route to c3-ref
- "convention", "standard" → route to c3-ref

Key indicator: User wants documentation/design output, NOT code changes.
Requires .c3/ to exist. Creates ADR with status: provisioned.
For implementation requests, route to c3-alter.
