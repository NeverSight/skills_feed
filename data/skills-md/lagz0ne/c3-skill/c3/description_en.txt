Routes C3 architecture requests and audits existing C3 documentation for consistency.
Use when the user asks to "audit architecture", "validate C3", "check C3 docs", "verify docs",
"check documentation", "are docs up to date", or when no .c3/ directory exists (routes to onboarding).
Routes navigation to c3-query, changes to c3-alter, patterns to c3-ref, design to c3-provision.
