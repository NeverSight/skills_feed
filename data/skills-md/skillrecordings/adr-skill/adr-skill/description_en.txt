Create and maintain Architecture Decision Records (ADRs) optimized for agentic coding workflows. Use when you need to propose, write, update, accept/reject, deprecate, or supersede an ADR; bootstrap an adr folder and index; consult existing ADRs before implementing changes; or enforce ADR conventions. This skill uses Socratic questioning to capture intent before drafting, and validates output against an agent-readiness checklist.
