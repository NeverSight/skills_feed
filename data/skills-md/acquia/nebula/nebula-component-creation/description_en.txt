Create React components by copying and modifying examples from `examples/components/`. Use when asked to (1) Create, add, or build a new component, (2) Copy an example component to `src/components/`, (3) Add a component with dependencies. Handles dependency resolution and ensures each component has `index.jsx` and `component.yml`.
