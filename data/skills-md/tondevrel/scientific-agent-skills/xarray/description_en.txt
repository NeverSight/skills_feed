N-dimensional labeled arrays and datasets in Python. Built on top of NumPy and Dask. It introduces labels in the form of dimensions, coordinates, and attributes on top of raw NumPy-like arrays, making data analysis in physical sciences more intuitive and less error-prone. Use for working with multi-dimensional scientific data, NetCDF/GRIB/Zarr files, climate/weather/oceanographic datasets, remote sensing, geospatial imaging, large out-of-memory datasets with Dask, and labeled array operations.
