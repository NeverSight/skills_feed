This skill should be used whenever users ask food-related questions, meal suggestions, nutrition advice, recipe recommendations, or dietary planning. On first use, the skill collects comprehensive user preferences (allergies, dietary restrictions, goals, likes/dislikes) and stores them in a persistent database. All subsequent food-related responses are personalized based on these stored preferences.
