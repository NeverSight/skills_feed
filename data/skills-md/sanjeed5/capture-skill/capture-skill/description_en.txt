Capture learnings, patterns, or workflows from the current conversation into a new or existing skill. Use when the user wants to save what was learned, discovered, or built during a conversation as a reusable skill for future sessions. Triggers include "capture this as a skill", "save this for next time", "turn this into a skill", or when a useful workflow, pattern, or piece of domain knowledge emerged during the conversation.
