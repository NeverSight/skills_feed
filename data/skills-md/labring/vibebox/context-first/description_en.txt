Use when user asks about features, requests implementation, discusses functionality,
analyzes architecture, updates documentation, or mentions specific components like
OAuth, authentication, Logto, sync, Happy Server, messaging, chat, terminal, command,
zen mode, boxes, workspace. Ensures all work is grounded in documented design decisions.
Prevents assumptions and misaligned solutions by loading context first.
