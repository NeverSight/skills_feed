Decision-making framework for software development, Y Combinator / Silicon Valley style.
Based on real principles from Paul Graham, Sam Altman, Michael Seibel, Patrick Collison, and Brian Chesky.

Use when:
- Developing features or products
- Making technical decisions (what to do, how, when)
- Prioritizing work (P0, P1, P2)
- Evaluating whether to refactor or patch
- Deciding on technical debt
- Evaluating whether to add tests, CI/CD, or automation
- Any architecture or engineering decision

Triggers: development, code, feature, refactor, architecture, prioritize, technical decision,
what to do first, technical debt, tests, CI/CD, sprint, backlog
