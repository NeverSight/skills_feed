Transform long-form content (YouTube videos, podcasts, interviews, articles) into engaging short-form and long-form narratives. Extracts core insights and presents them in two styles: concise social media posts (300-800 characters with numbered emoji lists) and detailed narrative articles (1500-3000+ characters with story arcs). Use when users provide YouTube links, podcast transcripts, long articles, or interview content and want summaries, key insights, or content reformatted for different platforms.
