Spawn a single autonomous AI agent with a specific task, personality, and CLI backend (Claude, Gemini, OpenCode, Copilot). Agent accepts task from docs/todo/pending/, selects personality based on task type, and works autonomously with CLI tools. Integrates with docs-first workflow via task signals and progress tracking.
