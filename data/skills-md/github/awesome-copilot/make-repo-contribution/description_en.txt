All changes to code must follow the guidance documented in the repository. Before any issue is filed, branch is made, commits generated, or pull request (or PR) created, a search must be done to ensure the right steps are followed. Whenever asked to create an issue, commit messages, to push code, or create a PR, use this skill so everything is done correctly.
