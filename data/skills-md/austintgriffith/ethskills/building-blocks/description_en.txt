DeFi legos and protocol composability on Ethereum and L2s. Major protocols per chain — Aerodrome on Base, GMX/Pendle on Arbitrum, Velodrome on Optimism — plus mainnet primitives (Uniswap, Aave, Compound, Curve). How they work, how to build on them, and how to combine them. Use when building DeFi integrations, choosing protocols on a specific L2, designing yield strategies, or composing existing protocols into something new.
