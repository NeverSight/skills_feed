Frontend UX rules for Ethereum dApps that prevent the most common AI agent UI bugs. Mandatory patterns for onchain buttons, token approval flows, address display, USD values, RPC configuration, and pre-publish metadata. Built around Scaffold-ETH 2 but the patterns apply to any Ethereum frontend. Use when building any dApp frontend.
