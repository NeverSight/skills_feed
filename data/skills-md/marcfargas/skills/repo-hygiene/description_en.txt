Periodic repository health check — dependencies, git, CI/CD, code quality, docs, security. Use when: onboarding to a repo, weekly maintenance, after big refactors, before audits, "is this repo in good shape?". Triggers: "repo hygiene", "health check", "repo health", "clean up repo", "maintenance check", "audit repo", "repo audit".
