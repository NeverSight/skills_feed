Apply Paul Graham's principles when exploring ideas, evaluating opportunities, building products, or making important decisions. Use this skill when brainstorming, validating ideas, planning ventures, thinking through problems, or needing a framework for clear thinking. Triggers include "evaluate this idea", "should I pursue this", "help me think through", "is this worth doing", "startup idea", "opportunity analysis", or any creative/strategic thinking task.
