Design and implement beautiful, fluid Liquid Glass interfaces in Expo React Native apps. Covers four paths: (1) expo-glass-effect for UIKit-backed glass surfaces, (2) @expo/ui SwiftUI integration for native SwiftUI glass modifiers and advanced transitions, (3) Expo Router unstable native tabs for system Liquid Glass tab bars, and (4) @callstack/liquid-glass as a third-party alternative. Use when tasks mention "liquid glass", "glass effect", "frosted/translucent UI", "iOS 26 design", "native tabs", "expo-ui", "SwiftUI in Expo", or when shipping Apple-style glass with robust fallbacks, accessibility checks, HIG-aware design decisions (Foundations, Patterns, Components, Inputs), and cross-platform degradation.
