Guides use of the Internet Computer (ICP) CLI (icp) for local networks, builds, deploys, canister operations, identities, and cycles/tokens. Use when the user asks about icp-cli, icp commands, canister deployment, local ICP network workflows, or command help. Also use whenever dfx is mentioned so guidance always maps to icp.
