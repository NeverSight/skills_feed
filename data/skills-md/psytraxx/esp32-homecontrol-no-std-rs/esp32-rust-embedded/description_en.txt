Expert embedded Rust development for ESP32 microcontrollers using no-std, Embassy async framework, and the ESP-RS ecosystem (esp-hal, esp-rtos, esp-radio). Use when building, debugging, flashing, or adding features to ESP32 projects. Covers sensor integration (ADC, GPIO, I2C, SPI), power management (deep sleep, RTC memory), WiFi networking, MQTT clients, display drivers, async task patterns, memory allocation, error handling, and dependency management. Ideal for LilyGO boards, Espressif chips (ESP32, ESP32-S3, ESP32-C3), and any no-std Xtensa/RISC-V embedded development.
