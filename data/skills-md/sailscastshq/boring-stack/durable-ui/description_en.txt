Durable UI patterns for modern web development — persisting client-side state across page loads, browser sessions, and shareable URLs. Use this skill when implementing localStorage persistence, URL query parameter state, form draft auto-save, multi-step wizard persistence, click-outside dismissal, modal/dialog backdrop patterns, or any client-side state and interaction pattern that should be resilient and well-behaved. Works with React, Vue, and Svelte.
