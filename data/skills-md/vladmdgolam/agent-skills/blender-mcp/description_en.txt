Blender MCP expert for scene inspection, Python scripting, GLTF export, and material/animation extraction. Activate when: (1) using Blender MCP tools (get_scene_info, execute_python, screenshot, etc.), (2) writing Blender Python scripts for extraction or manipulation, (3) exporting scenes to GLTF/GLB for web (Three.js, R3F), (4) debugging material or texture export losses, (5) optimizing GLB files with gltf-transform, (6) using asset integrations (PolyHaven, Sketchfab, Hyper3D Rodin, Hunyuan3D). Covers critical export gotchas, material mapping survival, texture optimization pipeline, headless CLI patterns, and known failure modes.
