Reduce Claude Code token burn with proactive compacting, task-scoped sessions, checkpoint files, tiered docs, and relevance-based context pruning. Use when a user explicitly asks to reduce context usage/cost, run token benchmarks, or optimize CLAUDE.md. Do not use to expand product scope or skip correctness checks.
