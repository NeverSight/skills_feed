Build or extend an extensible UI self-check framework for Web UIs (React/Vite or plain HTML) using Playwright. Use when asked to add/upgrade ui-check or ui-watch flows, enforce data-qa/data-testid discovery, add theme/contrast checks, animation verification, loading state-machine checks, layout stability/overlap checks, modal scroll rules, or to document QA tagging standards and UI testing commands.
