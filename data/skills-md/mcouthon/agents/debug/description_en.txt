Systematic debugging with hypothesis-driven investigation. Use when something is broken, tests are failing, unexpected behavior occurs, or errors need investigation. Triggers on: "this is broken", "debug", "why is this failing", "unexpected error", "not working", "bug", "fix this issue", "investigate", "tests failing", "trace the error", "use debug mode". Full access mode - can run commands, add logging, and fix issues.
