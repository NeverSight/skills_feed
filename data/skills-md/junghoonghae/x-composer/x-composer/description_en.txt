Compose and post to X.com using Chrome CDP automation. Use when user asks to "post to X", "tweet", "draft a tweet", "share on X", or "write a thread". Handles Chrome launch, text input with emoji/unicode support, and multi-paragraph formatting via real browser automation (no API costs, bypasses anti-bot detection).
