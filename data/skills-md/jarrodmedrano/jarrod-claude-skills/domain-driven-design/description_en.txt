This skill should be used whenever domain modeling is taking place. It provides specialized guidance for type-driven and data-driven design based on Rich Hickey and Scott Wlaschin's principles. The skill helps contextualize current modeling within the existing domain model, identifies inconsistencies, builds ubiquitous language, and creates visualizations (Mermaid, Graphviz/DOT, ASCII diagrams) to communicate domain concepts clearly. Use this skill when designing types, modeling business domains, refactoring domain logic, or ensuring domain consistency across a codebase.
