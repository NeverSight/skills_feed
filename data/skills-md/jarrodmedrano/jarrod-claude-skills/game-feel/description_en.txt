Game feel consulting based on Steve Swink's "Game Feel: A Game Designer's Guide to Virtual Sensation" (Morgan Kaufmann, 2009). Use when helping with control responsiveness, input mapping, physics tuning, avatar movement, jump mechanics, polish effects, or analyzing why controls feel "floaty", "tight", "responsive", or "sluggish". Covers the psychology of real-time control, metrics for measuring feel, and practical tuning guidance. NOT for general game design - focused specifically on the tactile sensation of controlling virtual objects.
