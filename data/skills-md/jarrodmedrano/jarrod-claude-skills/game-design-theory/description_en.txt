Game design consulting based on Richard Rouse III's Game Design Theory and Practice. Use when helping with game design decisions, player psychology, gameplay systems, storytelling, playtesting, or evaluating fun. Provides frameworks for understanding what players want, creating engaging gameplay mechanics, balancing challenge and fun, non-linear design, in-game storytelling, and effective playtesting practices. NOT for coding or programming - focused on design philosophy and player experience.
