Build, refactor, and debug Arcium MXE program code across Arcis circuits (`encrypted-ixs`) and Anchor programs (`programs/*`). Use when implementing confidential instructions, wiring `init_comp_def`/`queue_computation`/callbacks, deriving Arcium PDAs and callback accounts, handling encrypted I/O and offsets, parsing generated callback output structs, building permission-gated flows, integrating offchain circuit sources, testing with `@arcium-hq/client`, deploying MXEs, or migrating Arcium versions.
