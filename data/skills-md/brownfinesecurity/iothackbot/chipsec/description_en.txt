Static analysis of UEFI/BIOS firmware dumps using Intel's chipsec framework. Decode firmware structure, detect known malware and rootkits (LoJax, ThinkPwn, HackingTeam, MosaicRegressor), generate EFI executable inventories with hashes, extract NVRAM variables, and parse SPI flash descriptors. Use when analyzing firmware .bin/.rom/.fd/.cap files offline without requiring hardware access.
