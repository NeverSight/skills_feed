Discover existing shadcn components from registries before building custom. Use PROACTIVELY when about to build any UI component, page section, or layout. Use when user explicitly asks to find/search components. Searches 1,500+ components across official and community registries including @shadcn, @blocks, @reui, @animate-ui, @diceui, Magic UI, and 30+ specialty registries. Provides install commands and code examples. Works best with shadcn MCP configured, but provides manual guidance without it.
