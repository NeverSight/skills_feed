Build reasoning-based RAG systems using PageIndex architecture. Replaces vector databases with hierarchical table-of-contents indices and LLM-driven navigation. Use when (1) implementing RAG for long structured documents (financial reports, legal contracts, technical manuals), (2) improving existing vector-based RAG systems with poor accuracy on structured content, (3) designing document indexing strategies with semantic coherence, (4) explaining PageIndex concepts including reasoning-based retrieval, hierarchical navigation, and cross-reference following, or (5) handling documents with internal references and multi-turn conversations. Focuses on technical architecture, core research insights, and practical implementation patterns rather than using the PageIndex package directly.
