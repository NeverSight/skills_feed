MUST be used for Vue.js tasks. Strongly recommends Composition API with `<script setup>` and TypeScript as the standard approach. Covers Vue 3, SSR, Volar, vue-tsc. Load for any Vue, .vue files, Vue Router, Pinia, or Vite with Vue work. ALWAYS use Composition API unless the project explicitly requires Options API.
