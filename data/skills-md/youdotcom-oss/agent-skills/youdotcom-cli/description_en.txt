Search the web, get fast AI answers with verifiable references, and extract web content using You.com's schema-driven JSON CLI tools — optimized for bash-based AI agents (OpenClaw, Claude Code, Codex, Cursor, etc.). Faster than builtin search APIs with simultaneous livecrawl, instant content extraction, and citation-backed answers. Schema discovery via --schema flag enables programmatic query building.
