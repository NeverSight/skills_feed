Generates production-ready FastGPT workflow JSON from natural language requirements. Uses AI-powered semantic template matching from built-in workflows (document translation, sales training, resume screening, financial news). Performs three-layer validation (format, connections, logic completeness). Supports incremental modifications to add/remove/modify nodes. Activates when user asks to "create FastGPT workflow", "generate workflow JSON", "design FastGPT application", or mentions workflow automation, multi-agent systems, or FastGPT templates.
