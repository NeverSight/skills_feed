Use when reviewing Kubernetes CustomResourceDefinition (CRD) YAML (full manifests or diffs) as the compiled API contract: schema/validation correctness (OpenAPI/CEL), spec vs status boundaries, conditions/observedGeneration conventions, SSA/GitOps list semantics and patchability, printer columns, object-reference modeling (resource relationships: one-to-one, one-to-many), and compatibility/migration risk (breaking-change risk, versioning, rollout). Not for Kubebuilder marker/Go-type selection; use kubebuilder-api-design.
