This skill teaches AI coding agents how to use vx - the universal development tool manager.
Use this skill whenever the user's project uses vx (has vx.toml or .vx/ directory),
or when the user mentions vx, tool version management, or cross-platform development setup.
vx transparently manages Node.js, Python, Go, Rust, and 50+ other tools with zero-config.
