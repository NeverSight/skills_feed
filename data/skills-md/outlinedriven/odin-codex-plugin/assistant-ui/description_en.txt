Build and maintain assistant-ui based React chat apps with reliable setup, runtime selection, LangGraph wiring, tool UI integration, and upgrade workflows. Use when tasks explicitly involve `assistant-ui` dependencies or APIs, including `assistant-ui` CLI commands (`create/init/add/update/upgrade/codemod`), `@assistant-ui/*` providers/runtimes, `AssistantRuntimeProvider`, Thread/Composer primitives, cloud persistence, or tool rendering behavior. Do not use for generic React chat work, backend-only LangGraph tasks, or non-assistant-ui UI work. If the prompt explicitly says without/no/not assistant-ui, do not trigger this skill.
