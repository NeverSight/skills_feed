Expert Python backend code reviewer that identifies over-complexity, duplicates, bad optimizations, and violations of best practices. Use when asked to review Python code quality, check for duplicate code, analyze module complexity, optimize backend code, identify anti-patterns, or ensure adherence to best practices. Ideal for preventing AI-generated code from creating unnecessary files instead of imports, finding repeated validation logic, and catching over-engineered solutions.
