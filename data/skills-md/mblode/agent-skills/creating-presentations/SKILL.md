# Creating Presentations

Bold, minimal, dark-first presentations designed for live presenting.

## Workflow

1. **Outline** the structure and narrative arc → [outline-structure.md](outline-structure.md)
2. **Write** bold, minimal slide copy → [writing-slides.md](writing-slides.md)
3. **Design** the visual layout and composition → [visual-design.md](visual-design.md)
4. **Add speaker notes** for natural delivery → [speaker-notes.md](speaker-notes.md)

**For investor pitch decks** (async, standalone): follow [pitch-decks.md](pitch-decks.md) instead — denser copy, 10-slide framework, optimized for reading without a presenter.

## Core principles

- **Dark-first, high contrast** — black/zinc-900 backgrounds, white text, colored accents
- **One message per slide** — if it takes more than 5 seconds to read, cut it
- **Headlines do the work** — bold statements, not explanations
- **Section colors create rhythm** — each major section gets its own accent color
- **Notes guide, not script** — scannable prompts for riffing, not paragraphs to read

## Context adjustments

- **Internal (team/company)**: assume shared context, be direct, reference history
- **External (conference/client)**: more setup, clearer transitions, define terms
- **Recorded/async**: tighter copy, stronger signposting, notes clarify what slides don't
