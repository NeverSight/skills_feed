# Audit Typography

89 rules across 10 categories for web typography quality. Focuses on concrete issues with concrete fixes.

## Audit Workflow

Copy and track this checklist during the audit:

```text
Audit progress:
- [ ] Step 1: Scope changed surfaces and select relevant categories
- [ ] Step 2: Run CRITICAL checks (punctuation, font setup)
- [ ] Step 3: Run HIGH checks (sizing, spacing)
- [ ] Step 4: Run MEDIUM+ checks for remaining categories in scope
- [ ] Step 5: Report findings with file:line and concrete fixes
```

1. Audit only changed files unless a full sweep is requested.
2. Scan CSS for font-family, @font-face, font-feature-settings, and sizing/spacing properties to identify relevant categories.
3. Load rule files progressively by category prefix — read only what applies.
4. Prioritize CRITICAL and HIGH findings before medium-priority polish.
5. After fixes, rerun the relevant rules before finalizing.
