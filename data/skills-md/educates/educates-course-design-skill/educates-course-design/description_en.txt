Guide for designing and planning Educates courses, which are structured collections of workshops for the Educates interactive training platform. Use this skill when the user asks to design a course, plan a course, extend an existing course, or organize topics into a multi-workshop curriculum. Do NOT use this skill when the user only wants to create a single standalone workshop; use the educates-workshop-authoring skill for that instead.
