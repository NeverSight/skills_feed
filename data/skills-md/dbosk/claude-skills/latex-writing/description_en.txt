markup. Use proactively when: (1) writing or editing .tex files, (2) writing 
or editing .nw literate programming files, (3) literate-programming skill is 
active and working with .nw files, (4) user mentions LaTeX, BibTeX, or 
document formatting, (5) reviewing LaTeX code quality. Ensures proper use of 
semantic environments (description vs itemize), csquotes (\enquote{} not 
``...''), and cleveref (\cref{} not \S\ref{}).
