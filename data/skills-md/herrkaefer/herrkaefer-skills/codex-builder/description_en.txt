Execute implementation plans by delegating to Codex CLI for autonomous code implementation. Use when: (1) User has a plan file generated by Claude Code's plan mode and wants to implement it, (2) User explicitly requests Codex to implement a plan, (3) After plan review is complete and ready for implementation, (4) User provides a path to a plan markdown file and wants automatic implementation. The skill reads the plan file and delegates full implementation to Codex.
