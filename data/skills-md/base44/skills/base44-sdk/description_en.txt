Use for writing JavaScript/TypeScript code with the Base44 SDK in EXISTING projects. Triggers: user wants to implement features, build functionality, or write code using Base44; code uses '@base44/sdk' imports; user mentions SDK methods like base44.entities, base44.auth, base44.agents, base44.functions, base44.integrations; user says 'add a feature', 'implement', 'build component', 'write code for'. NOT for: creating new projects, CLI commands (npx base44 create/deploy/login), or directories without base44/config.jsonc - use base44-cli instead.
