Use for Base44 CLI operations and project initialization. Triggers: user wants to create/initialize a new Base44 project; user mentions CLI commands (npx base44, yarn base44, create, login, logout, whoami, deploy, entities push, site deploy, functions deploy); directory is empty or missing base44/config.jsonc; user says 'create a Base44 app/project', 'setup Base44', 'deploy to Base44', 'push entities'. This skill is the PREREQUISITE for base44-sdk - always use this first for new projects before building features.
