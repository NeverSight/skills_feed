Before any destructive or irreversible operation (rm -rf, DROP TABLE, DELETE,
force push, branch deletion, truncate), orchestrate a safety cycle: assess
blast radius → confirm explicitly → document what happened. Chains pre-mortem
and you-sure with built-in documentation. No dangerous operation executes
without ceremony.
