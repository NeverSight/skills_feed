Before ANY significant development task (new feature, refactor, integration,
migration), run a complete planning ritual by orchestrating other skills in
sequence: rubber-duck (clarify scope) -> pre-mortem (assess risks) -> eta
(estimate time) -> final confirmation. Do not start coding until the battle
plan is approved.
