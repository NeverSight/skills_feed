When Claude discovers a non-obvious solution, unusual pattern, or hard-won
insight during a session, automatically forge it into a new skill. Don't
just note the learning - create the actual skill file so future sessions
benefit immediately. This is the flywheel: work → discovery → skill → smarter
future sessions → repeat.
