Before starting any significant task, force explicit evaluation of available
skills. For each potentially relevant skill, state YES/NO with reasoning.
Only proceed to implementation after skills have been consciously evaluated
and activated. Prevents the ~50% "coin flip" activation rate that occurs
when skills are passively available but not deliberately considered.
