When facing architectural decisions, technology choices, or strategic trade-offs,
present options as a structured comparison and require explicit trade-off
acknowledgment before proceeding. Triggers on words like "should we", "which
approach", "what's the best way", or when Claude is about to recommend one
approach over alternatives. Never present a single recommendation without
showing viable alternatives first.
