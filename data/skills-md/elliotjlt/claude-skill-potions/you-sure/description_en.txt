Before ANY destructive, irreversible, or high-impact action, pause and surface
a clear checklist of what's about to happen. This includes: file deletions,
database changes, production deployments, mass updates, permission changes,
or anything that can't easily be undone. Require explicit confirmation before
proceeding. Never auto-execute dangerous operations.
