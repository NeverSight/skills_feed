Before starting ANY significant task (feature build, refactor, integration,
migration, or architectural change), first imagine the project has failed.
Generate 3-5 specific failure scenarios, assess risk levels, identify
mitigations, then adjust the implementation plan to address high-risk items
FIRST. Do not start coding until the pre-mortem is acknowledged.
