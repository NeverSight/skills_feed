Standardize requirement/feature changes in an existing codebase (especially Chrome extensions) by turning "改需求/需求变更/调整交互/改功能/重构流程" into a repeatable loop: clarify acceptance criteria, confirm current behavior from code, assess impact/risk, design the new logic, implement with small diffs, run a fixed regression checklist, and update docs/decision log. Use when the user feels the change process is chaotic, when edits tend to sprawl across files, or when changes touch manifest/service worker/OAuth/storage/UI and need reliable verification + rollback planning.
