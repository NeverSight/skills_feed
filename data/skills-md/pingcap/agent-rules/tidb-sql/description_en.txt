Write, review, and adapt SQL for TiDB with correct handling of TiDB-vs-MySQL differences (VECTOR type + vector indexes/functions, full-text search, AUTO_RANDOM, optimistic/pessimistic transactions, foreign keys, views, DDL limitations, and unsupported MySQL features like procedures/triggers/events/GEOMETRY/SPATIAL). Use when generating SQL that must run on TiDB, migrating MySQL SQL to TiDB, or debugging TiDB SQL compatibility errors.
