Comprehensive PostgreSQL configuration and usage analysis for Rails applications. Use when Claude Code needs to analyze a Rails codebase for database performance issues, optimization opportunities, or best practice violations. Detects N+1 queries, missing indexes, suboptimal database configurations, anti-patterns, and provides actionable recommendations. Ideal for performance audits, optimization tasks, or when users ask to "analyze the database", "check for N+1 queries", "optimize PostgreSQL", "review database performance", or "suggest database improvements".
