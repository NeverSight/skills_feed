Writing high-quality unit tests for JavaScript and TypeScript using Jest. Covers test structure (AAA pattern, USE naming), breaking dependencies (stubs, mocks, dependency injection), testing async code (promises, callbacks, timers), avoiding flaky tests, and test-driven development. Use when writing tests, debugging test failures, refactoring tests for maintainability, or questions about Jest, TDD, mocks, stubs, or test best practices.
