Reviews embedded Rust firmware for RP2350 (Raspberry Pi Pico 2 W) and ESP32-S3 (Heltec) microcontrollers with focus on Embassy async runtime, memory constraints, LED control, CAN attachment protocols, and SLCAN bridging. Use when reviewing MCU firmware changes, debugging LED controller issues, evaluating Embassy async patterns, checking static memory allocation, validating SLCAN implementations, or assessing hardware-specific code for WS2812 LEDs, CAN peripherals, and tool attachments. Covers no_std environments, PIO state machines, RMT peripherals, and USB CDC serial communication.
