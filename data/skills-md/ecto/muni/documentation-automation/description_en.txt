Automatically maintains project documentation including CHANGELOG.md, README files, inline code documentation, and cross-references. Use proactively after implementing features, fixing bugs, making API changes, or completing significant work. Updates CHANGELOG.md with conventional commit format, adds README sections for new features, generates inline documentation for new functions/structs/components, and ensures documentation cross-references are up-to-date. Covers Rust doc comments, TypeScript JSDoc, conventional commits (feat/fix/docs/refactor/test/chore), and multi-level README organization.
