Guides end-to-end testing, mocking, and simulation for the Muni codebase. Use when writing integration tests, setting up test environments, creating mock CAN bus, testing WebSocket protocols, validating database fixtures, or debugging test failures. Covers Rust test patterns (tokio::test, integration tests), TypeScript testing (Vitest), mock infrastructure (Docker Compose for tests), CAN bus simulation, WebSocket test clients, database seeding, and Rerun recording validation. Essential for ensuring components work together correctly.
