**MANDATORY for ALL MCP server work** - mcp-use framework best practices and patterns.

**READ THIS FIRST** before any MCP server work, including:
- Creating new MCP servers
- Modifying existing MCP servers (adding/updating tools, resources, prompts, widgets)
- Debugging MCP server issues or errors
- Reviewing MCP server code for quality, security, or performance
- Answering questions about MCP development or mcp-use patterns
- Making ANY changes to server.tool(), server.resource(), server.prompt(), or widgets

This skill contains critical architecture decisions, security patterns, and common pitfalls.
Always consult the relevant reference files BEFORE implementing MCP features.
