Use when: (1) querying MSSQL/SQL Server databases, (2) exploring database schemas/tables, (3) running SELECT queries for data analysis, (4) checking database contents. Supports multiple database connections with descriptions for intelligent auto-selection. Blocks all write operations (INSERT, UPDATE, DELETE, DROP, etc.) for safety.
