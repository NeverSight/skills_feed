Expertise in structured Git commit workflow with Chinese team conventions. Use this skill when the user asks to "commit", "提交", "stage", "暂存", "show status", "git status", or any variant related to managing git changes. The user does NOT need to explicitly mention "git-commit-workflow" - ANY request to commit changes or manage git state should automatically trigger this skill. Handles automatic commit message generation with PMS and GitHub Issue tracking, following strict 80-character line limits.
