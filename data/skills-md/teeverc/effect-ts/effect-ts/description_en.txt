Effect-TS (Effect) guidance for TypeScript: designing and implementing Effect-based code, modeling expected errors vs defects, managing dependencies with Context/Layer/Effect.Service, handling resource lifecycles with Scope, running effects at the program edge, using Effect.gen, validating data with Effect Schema, and testing time with TestClock. Use when asked to build, refactor, review, or explain Effect code or when converting Promise/async code to Effect.
