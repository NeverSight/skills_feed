Manage Redmine issues/tickets from the command line via the Redmine REST API using a `red-cli`-style interface. Uses `~/.red/config.json` for auth (server + api-key) with optional local overrides in `./.red/config.json`. Use when you need to list issues/projects, view issues (with journals), add journal notes/comments (public or private), update issue description, update/remove existing comments (journals) by journal id, filter/sort/paginate lists, or troubleshoot Redmine CLI configuration (project-id/user-id, multi-instance `--rid`). Triggers on Redmine, red-cli, issue list/view/note/edit/comment, `--rid`, `.red/config.json`, `api-key`, `project-id`, `user-id`, or requests to automate Redmine from a CLI.
