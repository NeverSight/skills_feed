Summarize lessons learned from ccbox session logs (projects/sessions/history/skills) so the agent can do better next time. Produce copy-ready instruction updates (project + global) backed by evidence, with optional skill-span context to attribute failures to specific skills. Use when asked to run /ccbox:insights, generate a "lessons learned" memo, or propose standing instructions from session history.
