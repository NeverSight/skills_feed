Transform raw data into analytical assets using ETL/ELT patterns, SQL (dbt), Python (pandas/polars/PySpark), and orchestration (Airflow). Use when building data pipelines, implementing incremental models, migrating from pandas to polars, or orchestrating multi-step transformations with testing and quality checks.
