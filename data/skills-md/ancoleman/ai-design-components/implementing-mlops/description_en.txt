Strategic guidance for operationalizing machine learning models from experimentation to production. Covers experiment tracking (MLflow, Weights & Biases), model registry and versioning, feature stores (Feast, Tecton), model serving patterns (Seldon, KServe, BentoML), ML pipeline orchestration (Kubeflow, Airflow), and model monitoring (drift detection, observability). Use when designing ML infrastructure, selecting MLOps platforms, implementing continuous training pipelines, or establishing model governance.
