API design and implementation across REST, GraphQL, gRPC, and tRPC patterns. Use when building backend services, public APIs, or service-to-service communication. Covers REST frameworks (FastAPI, Axum, Gin, Hono), GraphQL libraries (Strawberry, async-graphql, gqlgen, Pothos), gRPC (Tonic, Connect-Go), tRPC for TypeScript, pagination strategies (cursor-based, offset-based), rate limiting, caching, versioning, and OpenAPI documentation generation. Includes frontend integration patterns for forms, tables, dashboards, and ai-chat skills.
