When designing distributed systems for scalability, reliability, and consistency. Covers CAP/PACELC theorems, consistency models (strong, eventual, causal), replication patterns (leader-follower, multi-leader, leaderless), partitioning strategies (hash, range, geographic), transaction patterns (saga, event sourcing, CQRS), resilience patterns (circuit breaker, bulkhead), service discovery, and caching strategies for building fault-tolerant distributed architectures.
