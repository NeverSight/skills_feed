Strategic guidance for designing modern data platforms, covering storage paradigms (data lake, warehouse, lakehouse), modeling approaches (dimensional, normalized, data vault, wide tables), data mesh principles, and medallion architecture patterns. Use when architecting data platforms, choosing between centralized vs decentralized patterns, selecting table formats (Iceberg, Delta Lake), or designing data governance frameworks.
