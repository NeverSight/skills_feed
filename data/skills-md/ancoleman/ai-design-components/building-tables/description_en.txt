Use when creating tables, implementing sorting/filtering/pagination, handling large datasets (10-1M+ rows), building spreadsheet-like interfaces, or designing data-heavy components. Provides performance optimization strategies, accessibility patterns (WCAG/ARIA), responsive designs, and library recommendations (TanStack Table, AG Grid).
