Coordinate a cross-functional star-team workflow (Product Manager, Principal Engineer, Backend, Frontend, QA/Security, DevOps) with mandatory architecture and code-review checkpoints. Use when a request needs end-to-end product delivery, multi-role collaboration, or explicit role-based outputs (PM/PE/Backend/Frontend/QA/DevOps), or when the user asks for "star team", "cross-functional", "full lifecycle", or "multi-role" planning.
