Manage local development proxies using Caddy server's Admin API. Use when users need to allocate localhost ports, create reverse proxies for local dev servers, track which ports are in use across Claude Code sessions, or access apps via friendly URLs like myapp.localhost. Triggers on "set up a proxy", "allocate a port", "what's running on localhost", "register my app", or any Caddy configuration task.
