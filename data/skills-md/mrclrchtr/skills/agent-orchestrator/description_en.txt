Coordinate complex work using a phase-gated, multi-agent engineering loop (audit → design → implement → review → validate → deliver). Use when you need to split a task into subsystems, run dual independent audits, reconcile findings into a confirmed issue list, delegate fixes in clusters, enforce dual-review PASS gates, and drive an end-to-end delivery. Prefer discovering and invoking other specialized skills when they can execute part of the work faster or more reliably.
