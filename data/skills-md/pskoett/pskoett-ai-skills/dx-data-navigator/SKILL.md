# DX Data Navigator

Query the DX Data Cloud PostgreSQL database using the `mcp__DX_Data__queryData` tool.

## Tool Usage

```
mcp__DX_Data__queryData(sql: "SELECT ...")
```

Always query `information_schema.columns` first if uncertain about table/column names:
```sql
SELECT column_name, data_type FROM information_schema.columns
WHERE table_name = 'table_name' ORDER BY ordinal_position;
```

## Critical: Team Tables

Three team table types exist - use the right one:

| Table | Use Case |
|-------|----------|
| `dx_teams` | Current org structure, linking users to teams for PR/deployment metrics |
| `dx_snapshot_teams` | Teams within DX survey snapshots (use for DX scores) |
| `dx_versioned_teams` | Historical team structure at specific dates |

**For DX survey scores:** Join through `dx_snapshot_teams`. Use GROUP BY to avoid duplicates (team names can appear multiple times across snapshot history):
```sql
SELECT st.name as team, i.name as metric, MAX(ts.score) as score, MAX(ts.vs_industry50) as vs_industry
FROM dx_snapshot_team_scores ts
JOIN dx_snapshot_teams st ON ts.team_id = st.id
JOIN dx_snapshot_items i ON ts.item_id = i.id AND i.snapshot_id = ts.snapshot_id
WHERE ts.snapshot_id = (SELECT id FROM dx_snapshots ORDER BY end_date DESC LIMIT 1)
  AND st.name = 'Your Team Name'
  AND i.item_type = 'core4'
GROUP BY st.name, i.name;
```

**For PR/deployment metrics by team:** Join through `dx_users` to `dx_teams`:
```sql
SELECT t.name, COUNT(*) as prs
FROM pull_requests p
JOIN dx_users u ON p.dx_user_id = u.id
JOIN dx_teams t ON u.team_id = t.id
WHERE p.merged IS NOT NULL GROUP BY t.name;
```

## Discovering Team Names

Query the database to find available teams:
```sql
SELECT name FROM dx_teams WHERE deleted_at IS NULL ORDER BY name;
```

## Data Domains

### Core DX Metrics
Survey snapshots with team scores, benchmarks, and sentiment data.

**Key tables:** `dx_snapshots`, `dx_snapshot_teams`, `dx_snapshot_items`, `dx_snapshot_team_scores`

**dx_snapshots columns:** id, account_id, contributors, participation_rate, start_date (date), end_date (date)

**dx_snapshot_teams columns:** id, snapshot_id, team_id, name, parent (boolean), flattened_parent, contributors, participation_rate

**dx_snapshot_items columns:** id, snapshot_id, name, item_type, prompt, target_label

**dx_snapshot_team_scores columns:** id, snapshot_id, team_id (FK to dx_snapshot_teams.id), item_id (FK to dx_snapshot_items.id), score, vs_org, vs_prev, vs_industry50, vs_industry75, vs_industry90, unit

**Item types in dx_snapshot_items:**
- `core4`: Effectiveness, Impact, Quality, Speed
- `kpi`: Ease of delivery, Engagement, Weekly time loss, Quality, Speed
- `sentiment`: Deep work, Change Confidence, Documentation, Cross-team collaboration, Customer focus, Decision-making, etc.
- `workflow`: Review wait time, CI wait time, Deploy frequency, PR merge frequency, AI time savings, Red tape, etc.
- `workflow_averages`: Raw average values for workflow metrics (actual numbers, not percentiles)
- `csat`: Tool satisfaction scores (e.g., code editors, issue trackers, CI/CD tools)

```sql
-- Latest snapshot info
SELECT id, start_date, end_date, contributors, participation_rate
FROM dx_snapshots ORDER BY end_date DESC LIMIT 1;

-- Team scores for specific metric (use GROUP BY to dedupe)
SELECT st.name as team, i.name as metric, MAX(ts.score) as score, MAX(ts.vs_industry50) as vs_industry
FROM dx_snapshot_team_scores ts
JOIN dx_snapshot_teams st ON ts.team_id = st.id

WHERE ts.snapshot_id = (SELECT id FROM dx_snapshots ORDER BY end_date DESC LIMIT 1)
  AND st.name = 'Your Team Name'
  AND i.item_type = 'core4'
GROUP BY st.name, i.name;

-- All teams comparison on one metric
SELECT st.name as team, MAX(ts.score) as score, MAX(ts.vs_industry50) as vs_industry
FROM dx_snapshot_team_scores ts
JOIN dx_snapshot_teams st ON ts.team_id = st.id
JOIN dx_snapshot_items i ON ts.item_id = i.id AND i.snapshot_id = ts.snapshot_id
WHERE ts.snapshot_id = (SELECT id FROM dx_snapshots ORDER BY end_date DESC LIMIT 1)
  AND i.name = 'Effectiveness' AND i.item_type = 'core4'

**pull_requests key columns:** id, dx_user_id, repo_id, title, base_ref, head_ref, additions, deletions, created, merged, closed, draft, bot_authored

**Key metrics (all in seconds, divide by 3600 for hours):**
- `open_to_merge`: Total PR cycle time
- `open_to_first_review`: Time to first review
- `open_to_first_approval`: Time to approval
- Business hour variants: add `_business_hours` suffix

```sql
-- PR metrics by team last 30 days
SELECT t.name, COUNT(*) as prs,
       AVG(p.open_to_merge)/3600 as avg_hours_to_merge,
       AVG(p.open_to_first_review)/3600 as avg_hours_to_first_review
FROM pull_requests p
JOIN dx_users u ON p.dx_user_id = u.id
JOIN dx_teams t ON u.team_id = t.id
WHERE p.merged IS NOT NULL AND p.created > NOW() - INTERVAL '30 days'
GROUP BY t.name ORDER BY prs DESC;

-- PR size distribution
SELECT
    CASE
        WHEN additions + deletions < 50 THEN 'XS (<50)'
        WHEN additions + deletions < 200 THEN 'S (50-199)'
        WHEN additions + deletions < 500 THEN 'M (200-499)'
        ELSE 'L (500+)'
    END as size_bucket,
    COUNT(*) as count,
    AVG(open_to_merge)/3600 as avg_hours
FROM pull_requests

**Linking Copilot to teams:** GitHub logins don't match DX user emails directly. Use `github_users.verified_emails` to link:
```sql
-- Copilot usage by team (via github_users email linking)
SELECT t.name as team, COUNT(DISTINCT c.login) as active_copilot_users
FROM github_copilot_daily_usages c
JOIN github_users gu ON c.login = gu.login

GROUP BY t.name ORDER BY active_copilot_users DESC;
```

```sql
-- Daily Copilot active users (overall)
SELECT date, COUNT(*) FILTER (WHERE active) as active_users
FROM github_copilot_daily_usages
WHERE date > NOW() - INTERVAL '30 days'
GROUP BY date ORDER BY date;

-- Copilot adoption rate (latest day)
SELECT
    COUNT(DISTINCT login) FILTER (WHERE active) as active_users,
    COUNT(DISTINCT login) as total_users,
    COUNT(DISTINCT login) FILTER (WHERE active)::float / COUNT(DISTINCT login) * 100 as adoption_pct
FROM github_copilot_daily_usages
WHERE date = (SELECT MAX(date) FROM github_copilot_daily_usages);

-- Weekly trend
SELECT DATE_TRUNC('week', date) as week,

FROM pipeline_runs WHERE started_at > NOW() - INTERVAL '30 days';

-- Pipeline duration trend
SELECT DATE_TRUNC('week', started_at) as week,
       AVG(duration)/60 as avg_minutes

## Data Quality Notes

**Known issues:**
- Some team names may have typos - verify names by querying `dx_teams`
- `incident_services` table is empty - incidents cannot be linked to specific services
- `dx_users` AI adoption date fields are mostly NULL - use `github_copilot_daily_usages` instead
- DX survey scores may have duplicates - always use GROUP BY with MAX() aggregation

## Common Query Patterns

### DORA Metrics
```sql
-- Deployment Frequency (daily average, production only)
SELECT COUNT(*)::float / 30 as deploys_per_day FROM deployments
WHERE deployed_at > NOW() - INTERVAL '30 days' AND environment IN ('prod', 'production');

-- Lead Time for Changes (PR cycle time)
SELECT
    AVG(open_to_merge)/3600 as avg_hours,
    PERCENTILE_CONT(0.5) WITHIN GROUP (ORDER BY open_to_merge)/3600 as median_hours
FROM pull_requests
WHERE merged IS NOT NULL AND created > NOW() - INTERVAL '30 days';

-- Mean Time to Recovery
SELECT AVG(started_to_resolved)/3600 as mttr_hours FROM incidents
WHERE resolved_at IS NOT NULL AND priority IN ('1 - Critical', '2 - High')
  AND started_at > NOW() - INTERVAL '90 days';

-- Change Failure Rate (requires correlating incidents with deployments)
```

### Time-based Trends
```sql
-- Weekly PR throughput trend
SELECT DATE_TRUNC('week', merged) as week, COUNT(*) as prs
FROM pull_requests WHERE merged > NOW() - INTERVAL '90 days'
GROUP BY week ORDER BY week;

-- Monthly deployment trend
SELECT DATE_TRUNC('month', deployed_at) as month, COUNT(*) as deploys
FROM deployments WHERE deployed_at > NOW() - INTERVAL '12 months'
GROUP BY month ORDER BY month;
```

### Historical DX Survey Comparison
```sql
-- Compare team scores across all surveys
SELECT s.end_date as survey_date, i.name as metric, ts.score
FROM dx_snapshot_team_scores ts
JOIN dx_snapshots s ON ts.snapshot_id = s.id
JOIN dx_snapshot_teams st ON ts.team_id = st.id AND st.snapshot_id = s.id
JOIN dx_snapshot_items i ON ts.item_id = i.id AND i.snapshot_id = s.id
WHERE st.name = 'Your Team Name'
  AND i.item_type = 'core4'
  AND ts.score IS NOT NULL
ORDER BY s.end_date, i.name;

-- Teams that improved most since last survey (use vs_prev)
SELECT st.name as team, i.name as metric, MAX(ts.score) as score, MAX(ts.vs_prev) as change
FROM dx_snapshot_team_scores ts
JOIN dx_snapshot_teams st ON ts.team_id = st.id
JOIN dx_snapshot_items i ON ts.item_id = i.id AND i.snapshot_id = ts.snapshot_id
WHERE ts.snapshot_id = (SELECT id FROM dx_snapshots ORDER BY end_date DESC LIMIT 1)
  AND i.name = 'Effectiveness' AND i.item_type = 'core4'
  AND st.parent = false
GROUP BY st.name, i.name
ORDER BY change DESC NULLS LAST;
```

### Tool Satisfaction Analysis
```sql
-- Tool satisfaction scores (csat)
SELECT i.name as tool, AVG(ts.score) as avg_satisfaction, COUNT(DISTINCT st.name) as teams_using
FROM dx_snapshot_team_scores ts
JOIN dx_snapshot_teams st ON ts.team_id = st.id
JOIN dx_snapshot_items i ON ts.item_id = i.id AND i.snapshot_id = ts.snapshot_id
WHERE ts.snapshot_id = (SELECT id FROM dx_snapshots ORDER BY end_date DESC LIMIT 1)
  AND i.item_type = 'csat' AND st.parent = false AND ts.score IS NOT NULL
GROUP BY i.name ORDER BY avg_satisfaction ASC;
```
