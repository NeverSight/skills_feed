# E-commerce Copywriting

Write copy that converts browsers into buyers. This skill covers every touchpoint in an e-commerce store.

## Before Writing

Check for existing context:
- `.claude/product-marketing-context.md` — brand voice, positioning
- `.claude/brand-guidelines.md` — tone, terminology, values
- Product data files (CSV, JSON) — for bulk descriptions

Gather missing context:

### Store Context
- Store type? (fashion, electronics, food, B2B, luxury, budget)
- Target customer? (demographics, pain points, buying motivations)
- Price positioning? (premium, mid-range, value)
- Brand voice? (playful, professional, minimalist, bold)

### Product Context
- Product category and unique selling points
- Key differentiators from competitors
- Common objections or hesitations
- Available proof points (reviews, certifications, awards)

## Core Principles

### Benefits Over Features
Transform specs into outcomes. For every feature, ask "So what?"

❌ "500ml capacity"
✅ "Enough for your full morning workout"

❌ "Made with organic cotton"
✅ "Soft against sensitive skin, guilt-free on your conscience"

### Specificity Sells
Vague claims erode trust. Prove everything.

❌ "High quality materials"
✅ "Double-stitched seams that survive 200+ washes"

❌ "Fast shipping"
✅ "Ships same-day before 2pm, arrives in 2-3 days"

### Speak Their Language
Use customer vocabulary, not industry jargon. Mirror language from:
- Product reviews
- Support tickets
- Social media comments
- Competitor reviews (what's missing?)

### Scannable Structure
80% of shoppers scan. Structure for scanning:
- Lead with the hook
- Use bullet points for features/specs
- Bold key benefits
- Keep paragraphs to 2-3 sentences max

### Mobile-First Writing
60-70% of e-commerce traffic is mobile:
- Short paragraphs (2-3 lines on mobile)
- Front-load important info
- CTAs visible without scrolling
- Test line breaks on narrow screens

## Page Types

### Product Pages
The money page. See [references/product-descriptions.md](references/product-descriptions.md) for templates.

**Structure:**
1. **Title** — Clear, searchable, include key attributes
2. **Hook** — First line that stops the scroll
3. **Benefits block** — 3-5 key benefits with icons
4. **Story/context** — Why this product exists, who it's for
5. **Social proof** — Reviews, ratings, "X sold"
6. **Specs** — Collapsible or tabbed for scanners
7. **Trust signals** — Shipping, returns, guarantees

**Quick example:**
```
[Title] The Everyday Backpack — 20L | Weatherproof
[Hook] The bag that survives your commute and looks good doing it.
[Benefits]
• Fits 15" laptop + gym clothes + lunch
• Waterproof zippers keep your tech dry
• Hidden anti-theft pocket for valuables
[Story] Designed by commuters who were tired of choosing between style and function...
```

### Category Pages
Often overlooked. Category descriptions:
- Help SEO (unique content)
- Guide purchase decisions
- Build topical authority

**Pattern:**
```
[H1] Men's Running Shoes

Find your perfect running partner. Whether you're training for a marathon
or crushing your daily 5K, our collection covers every stride style and foot type.

**Not sure where to start?**
→ New to running? Try our cushioned everyday trainers
→ Speed work? Check our lightweight racers
→ Trail runner? Browse our grip-focused off-road range
```

### Checkout Flow
Reduce abandonment with reassuring microcopy. See [references/checkout-copy.md](references/checkout-copy.md).

**Key moments:**
- **Cart** — Urgency + reassurance
- **Shipping step** — Clear expectations
- **Payment step** — Security signals
- **Confirmation** — Delight + next steps

### Homepage
Balance brand story with clear paths to products.

**Above fold:**
- Headline: Core value proposition
- Subhead: Who it's for + key benefit
- CTA: Clear primary action
- Trust bar: Payment icons, "Free shipping over €50"

### About Page
E-commerce about pages should still sell:
- Origin story that builds trust
- Values that resonate with target customer
- Team/founder story (humanizes the brand)
- CTA: Don't dead-end — link to bestsellers

## Product Descriptions

### Single Product
See [references/product-descriptions.md](references/product-descriptions.md) for full templates.

**Formula: AIDA-E**
- **Attention** — Hook that stops the scroll
- **Interest** — Benefit that creates curiosity
- **Desire** — Sensory language, imagine ownership
- **Action** — Clear CTA
- **Evidence** — Proof that backs claims

### Bulk Descriptions
For 50+ products, create a system:

1. **Define templates per category**
   - Fashion: Fit + material + occasion + care
   - Electronics: Problem solved + specs + compatibility
   - Food: Taste + ingredients + serving suggestion

2. **Build a formula**
   ```
   [Opening hook based on use case]
   [Primary benefit sentence]
   [Secondary benefit sentence]
   [Key specs as bullets]
   [Social proof if available]
   ```

3. **Create variation banks**
   - 10 opening hooks per category
   - 5 benefit phrasings per feature type
   - Rotate to avoid repetition

### SEO for Products
See [references/seo-ecommerce.md](references/seo-ecommerce.md).

**Title tag formula:**
`[Product Name] - [Key Attribute] | [Brand]`
Example: "Leather Weekender Bag - Carry-On Size | BrandName"

**Meta description formula:**
`[Benefit hook]. [Feature proof]. [CTA]. [Trust signal].`
Example: "Travel in style without checking bags. Fits overhead bins on all major airlines. Shop now — free returns for 30 days."

## Trust Signals & Microcopy

### Shipping Info
Be specific, reduce anxiety:

❌ "Fast shipping available"
✅ "Free shipping over €50 | Arrives in 2-4 business days"

❌ "International shipping"
✅ "We ship to 45+ countries | Duties calculated at checkout"

### Returns & Guarantees
Make it easy to say yes:

**Patterns:**
- "Not in love? Return within 30 days, no questions asked"
- "Try it risk-free for 60 days"
- "Lifetime warranty — we stand behind our craft"

### Security Signals
Reduce payment anxiety:

- "Secure checkout powered by Stripe"
- "Your data is encrypted and never stored"
- Payment icons (Visa, Mastercard, Apple Pay, etc.)
- Trust badges (if legitimate): SSL, money-back guarantee

### Social Proof Formats
- "4.8★ from 2,847 reviews"
- "Trusted by 50,000+ customers"
- "As seen in [Publication]"
- "Best-seller — 500 sold this month"

## Promotional Copy

### Sale/Discount
Create urgency without being sleazy:

✅ "Winter Sale — 30% off outerwear. Ends Sunday."
✅ "Member exclusive: Early access to Black Friday deals"
❌ "CRAZY PRICES!!! BUY NOW BEFORE IT'S GONE!!!"

### Limited Editions
Build scarcity authentically:

"Limited run — only 200 made. When they're gone, they're gone."
"Seasonal favorite returns — available through March"

### Bundles & Upsells
Position as value, not pushy:

"Complete the look" (fashion)
"Frequently bought together" (neutral)
"Save 15% when you bundle" (value-focused)

## Transactional Emails

See [references/email-templates.md](references/email-templates.md) for full templates.

### Order Confirmation
- Celebrate the purchase
- Set clear expectations
- Include order details
- Offer tracking info or next steps

### Shipping Notification
- Lead with tracking
- Arrival estimate
- What to do if issues

### Review Request
- Timing: 7-14 days post-delivery
- Make it easy (direct link)
- Offer incentive if appropriate

## Empty States & Edge Cases

### Empty Cart
Don't just say "Your cart is empty"

✅ "Your cart is feeling lonely. Let's fix that."
[Browse bestsellers] [Continue shopping]

### Out of Stock
- "Sold out — join waitlist for restock alerts"
- Suggest alternatives
- Show "back in stock" date if known

### 404 Page
- Acknowledge the error with personality
- Offer search
- Link to popular categories

### No Search Results
- "We couldn't find '[query]' — try a different search or browse our categories"
- Suggest popular products
- Check for typos
