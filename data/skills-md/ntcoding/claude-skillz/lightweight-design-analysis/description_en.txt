This skill analyzes code for design quality improvements across 8 dimensions: Naming, Object Calisthenics, Coupling & Cohesion, Immutability, Domain Integrity, Type System, Simplicity, and Performance. Ensures rigorous, evidence-based analysis by: (1) Understanding code flow first via implementation-analysis protocol, (2) Systematically evaluating each dimension with specific criteria, (3) Providing actionable findings with file:line references. Triggers when users request: code analysis, design review, refactoring opportunities, code quality assessment, architecture evaluation.
