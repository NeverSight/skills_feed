This skill should be used when fixing bugs, implementing features, debugging issues, or making code changes. Ensures understanding of code flow before implementation by: (1) Tracing execution path with specific file:line references, (2) Creating lightweight text diagrams showing class.method() flows, (3) Verifying understanding with user. Prevents wasted effort from assumptions or guessing. Triggers when users request: bug fixes, feature implementations, refactoring, TDD cycles, debugging, code analysis.
