# Hypothesis Driven 80/20

Use $ARGUMENTS as initial context.

## When to use this skill
- Structuring analysis around testable hypotheses.
- Prioritizing workstreams with 80/20 logic.
- Building a consulting workplan and evidence plan.

## How to use this skill
1. Define the governing question and success metrics.
2. Generate 3-7 hypotheses that could answer the question.
3. Prioritize hypotheses using 80/20 impact and feasibility.
4. Design tests and data needs for top hypotheses.
5. Build a workplan with owners, timing, and outputs.
6. Update hypotheses as evidence arrives.
7. If information is missing, ask targeted questions.

- `references/80-20-prioritization.md` - Scoring and sequencing.
- `templates/hypothesis-plan.md` - Final structure.
- `examples/hypothesis-example.md` - Sample output.

## Output guidelines
- Keep hypotheses falsifiable and directional.
- Explain why the top hypotheses matter most.
- Respond in English.

## Missing information to ask for
- Decision context and business objective.
- Available data sources and constraints.
- Timeline and stakeholders.
