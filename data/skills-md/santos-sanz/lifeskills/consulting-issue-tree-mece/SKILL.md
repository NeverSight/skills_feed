# MECE Issue Tree

Use $ARGUMENTS as initial context.

## When to use this skill
- Structuring complex problems into MECE drivers.
- Building root cause trees or analysis plans.
- Framing a consulting workstream breakdown.

## How to use this skill
1. Define the problem statement, scope, metric, and time horizon.
2. Choose a tree type: driver, process, option, or hypothesis.
3. Build a top-down MECE structure with clear labels.
4. Add assumptions and data sources per branch.
5. Prioritize branches by impact, controllability, feasibility.
6. Translate priority branches into analyses and workstreams.
7. If information is missing, ask targeted questions.

## Resources
- `references/issue-tree-patterns.md` - Common tree structures.
- `references/mece-checks.md` - Overlap and gap checks.
- `templates/issue-tree.md` - Final structure.
- `examples/issue-tree-example.md` - Sample output.

## Output guidelines
- Use clear, parallel branch labels.
- Provide the tree in ASCII when useful.
- Respond in English.

## Missing information to ask for
- Decision needed and success metric.
- Scope boundaries and constraints.
- Available data and stakeholders.
