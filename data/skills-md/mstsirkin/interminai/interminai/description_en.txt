Control interactive terminal applications like vim, git rebase -i, git add -i, git add -p, apt, rclone config, sudo, w3m, and TUI apps. Can also supervise another CLI LLM (cursor-agent, codex, etc.) - approve or reject its actions by pressing y/n at confirmation prompts. Use when you need to interact with applications that require keyboard input, show prompts, menus, or have full-screen interfaces. Also use when commands fail or hang with errors like "Input is not a terminal" or "Output is not a terminal". Better than application specific hacks such as GIT_SEQUENCE_EDITOR or bypassing interactivity through file use.
