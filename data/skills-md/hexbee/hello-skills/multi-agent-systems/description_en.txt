Design and implement multi-agent LLM architectures using the orchestrator-subagent pattern. Use when: (1) Deciding whether to use multi-agent vs single-agent systems, (2) Implementing context isolation for high-volume operations, (3) Parallelizing independent research tasks, (4) Creating specialized agents with focused tool sets, (5) Building verification subagents for quality assurance, or (6) Analyzing context-centric decomposition boundaries.
