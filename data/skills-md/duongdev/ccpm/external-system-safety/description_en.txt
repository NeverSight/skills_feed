Enforces confirmation workflow for EXTERNAL system writes (Jira, Confluence, BitBucket, Slack) ONLY. NEVER activates for Linear operations (Linear is internal tracking). Auto-activates when detecting potential writes to external PM systems (status updates, page creation, PR posts, notifications). Blocks execution and displays exact content that will be written. Requires explicit "yes" confirmation (rejects "ok", "sure", ambiguous responses). All Linear operations execute automatically without confirmation. Works alongside ccpm-code-review to ensure quality before external broadcasts. Provides audit trail of all confirmed operations. Allows batch operations with granular per-item confirmation when needed.
