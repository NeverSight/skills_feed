Guides intelligent planning strategies with automatic phase detection and complexity assessment. Auto-activates when users mention epic breakdown, feature decomposition, scope estimation, dependency analysis, risk identification, or ask "how do I plan this complex task", "break down this feature", "what's the scope", "estimate effort", "identify dependencies", or "planning strategy". Provides interactive planning mode with 6 planning phases (complexity assessment, scope definition, dependency analysis, risk identification, task breakdown, effort estimation). Works with sequential-thinking for complex decomposition, docs-seeker for research, pm-workflow-guide for command suggestions, and linear-subagent-guide for Linear integration.
