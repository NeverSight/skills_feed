Tracks and visualizes CCPM workflow state transitions (IDEA → PLANNED → IMPLEMENTING → VERIFYING → VERIFIED → COMPLETE). Prevents invalid state transitions and suggests appropriate next actions. Auto-activates when users ask about task status, "where am I in the workflow", "what should I do next", or "can I do this now".
