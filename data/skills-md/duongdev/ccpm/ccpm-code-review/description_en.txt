Enforces quality verification gates with four-step validation (tests pass, build succeeds, checklist complete, no blockers) before task completion, PR creation, or status updates. Auto-activates when user says "done", "complete", "finished", "ready to merge", or runs /ccpm:verify or /ccpm:done commands. Provides systematic verification workflow that prevents false completion claims and ensures production readiness. Blocks external system writes (Jira, Slack) until evidence collected. Integrates with external-system-safety for confirmation workflow. When verification fails, suggests /ccpm:verify to debug issues systematically.
