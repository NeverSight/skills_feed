Provides intelligent context-aware PM workflow guidance with automatic phase detection. Prioritizes 6 natural workflow commands (plan, work, sync, commit, verify, done) for streamlined project management. Auto-activates when user mentions planning, implementation, verification, spec management, or asks "what command should I use". Detects workflow phase and suggests optimal command path. Provides learning mode for new users. Prevents common mistakes and offers error prevention. Works with pm-workflow state machine (IDEA → PLANNED → IMPLEMENTING → VERIFYING → VERIFIED → COMPLETE).
