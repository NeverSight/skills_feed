Professional Excalidraw diagram generation expert that creates complete, valid .excalidraw files based on user descriptions. Use ONLY when users explicitly mention "Excalidraw" or request to create diagrams specifically with Excalidraw (e.g., "用 Excalidraw 画个流程图", "generate an Excalidraw diagram", "create Excalidraw file"). Do NOT trigger for generic diagram requests without Excalidraw mention. Generates ready-to-open files instead of requiring copy-paste.
