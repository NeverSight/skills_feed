DDD and CQRS architecture for .NET solutions: domain modeling (entities, aggregates, value objects), CQRS patterns (commands/queries with MediatR), layer boundaries, and infrastructure composition. Use when: (1) Designing domain models or aggregate boundaries, (2) Implementing commands, queries, or handlers, (3) Questions about entities vs value objects vs domain services, (4) Structuring layers (Domain, Application, Infrastructure, Presentation), (5) Setting up DI with extension methods in Infrastructure/Extensions, (6) Creating AddPersistence, AddRepositories, AddServices, AddExternalServices, AddConfigurations, or AddKeyVault methods, or (7) Organizing Program.cs composition.
