Playwright browser automation API, web scraping, and tooling. Covers locator strategies, assertions, API testing, stealth mode, anti-bot bypass, authenticated sessions, screenshots/PDFs, Docker deployment, configuration, debugging, and MCP integration with AI agents. Prevents documented errors including CI timeout hangs, extension testing failures, and navigation issues.

Use when automating browsers, scraping protected sites, bypassing bot detection, generating screenshots/PDFs, configuring Playwright Test, troubleshooting Playwright errors, or learning Playwright API patterns. For E2E test architecture, Page Object Models, CI sharding strategies, or test organization patterns, use the e2e-testing skill instead.
