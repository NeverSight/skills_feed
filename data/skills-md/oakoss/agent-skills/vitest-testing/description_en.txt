Covers test structure (describe/it/test.each), assertions with expect, lifecycle hooks, mocking (vi.fn/vi.mock/vi.spyOn), React Testing Library patterns, hook testing with renderHook, user-event interactions, async utilities, configuration, workspace setup, coverage, and advanced patterns like in-source testing and concurrent execution. Also covers CLI commands, test filtering, tags, sharding, fixtures with test.extend, and fixture scoping.

Use when writing unit tests, component tests, integration tests, or testing React hooks. Use for test configuration, mocking modules, testing async behavior, snapshot testing, or setting up test coverage.
