E2E test architecture and patterns with Playwright. Use when designing test suites, structuring Page Object Models, planning CI sharding strategies, setting up authentication flows, or organizing tests with tags and annotations. Use for test architecture, accessibility auditing with axe-core, network mocking strategies, visual regression workflows, HAR replay, and storageState authentication patterns.
