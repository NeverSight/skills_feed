Ensures zero-mismatch integrity between server-rendered HTML and client-side React trees. Use when debugging hydration errors, fixing text content mismatches, handling browser extension DOM pollution, implementing selective hydration with Suspense, using the React 19 use() hook for deterministic server-to-client data bridges, or applying Next.js use cache for data drift prevention. Use for hydration mismatch, SSR, hydrateRoot, suppressHydrationWarning, onRecoverableError, two-pass rendering.
