Covers type utilities (Pick, Omit, Partial, Record, Awaited), generics with constraints and inference, type guards and narrowing, discriminated unions, conditional and mapped types, template literal types, const assertions, satisfies operator, module patterns, and modern JavaScript idioms (eslint-plugin-unicorn). Use when building type-safe APIs, preventing runtime errors through types, working with strict TypeScript configuration, debugging complex type errors, or enforcing modern JS idioms. Use for generics, type guards, utility types, strict mode, type inference, narrowing, type safety, const assertions, satisfies, module augmentation, unicorn, for-of, modern-js.
