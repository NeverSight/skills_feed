Create and edit Arazzo workflow specification files (.arazzo.yaml) for API testing and orchestration. Use when building API test workflows, defining multi-step API sequences, writing API integration tests, or documenting API usage patterns. Triggers include: "arazzo", "workflow spec", "API workflow", "multi-step API test", ".arazzo.yaml", "orchestrate calls", or any request to describe API workflows with assertions.
