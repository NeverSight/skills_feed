Perform comprehensive security audits on Node.js, JavaScript, and TypeScript codebases. Scans source code for OWASP Top 10 vulnerabilities, insecure patterns, dependency risks, and generates a prioritized Markdown audit report with severity levels (Critical, High, Medium, Low), code citations, and remediation guidance. Use when asked to audit, review, scan, or check security of a Node.js/JS/TS project, find vulnerabilities, check for OWASP compliance, or generate a security report. Also triggers on: security review, pentest, vulnerability scan, is my code secure, check for injection, check dependencies. Do NOT trigger for: general code reviews, bugfix assistance, feature development, refactoring, performance optimization, or non-security tasks.
