Apply Model-First Reasoning (MFR) to code generation tasks. Use when the user requests "model-first", "MFR", "formal modeling before coding", "model then implement", or when tasks involve complex logic, state machines, constraint systems, or any implementation requiring formal correctness guarantees. Enforces strict separation between modeling and implementation phases.
