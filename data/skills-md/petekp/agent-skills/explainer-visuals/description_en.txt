Create high-quality animated explainer visuals for essays and blog posts. Use when the user wants to visualize concepts, processes, data, or ideas with interactive web animations. Triggers on requests like "create a visual for", "animate this concept", "make an explainer", "visualize this idea", "diagram this process", "show this data", or when essay content would benefit from visual explanation. Handles abstract concepts (mental models, frameworks), technical processes (algorithms, systems), and data visualization (trends, comparisons). Outputs self-contained HTML/CSS/JS that embeds directly in web content.
