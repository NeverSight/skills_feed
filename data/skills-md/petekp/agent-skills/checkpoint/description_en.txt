Meta-cognitive decision support that analyzes current context and surfaces intelligent next-step options to the user. Use this skill when: (1) User explicitly invokes /checkpoint, (2) Significant work has been completed and a checkpoint is valuable, (3) Uncertainty or ambiguity exists about requirements or approach, (4) Task complexity has expanded beyond initial scope, (5) Before finalizing or committing to ensure nothing is missed. This skill pauses execution, assesses the situation holistically, and presents 2-5 contextually-appropriate options via AskUserQuestion, with a recommended option and rationale.
