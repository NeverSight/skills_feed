Build a retrieval-optimized knowledge layer over agent documentation in dotfiles (.claude, .codex, .cursor, .aider). Use when asked to "optimize docs", "improve agent knowledge", "make docs more efficient", or when documentation has accumulated and retrieval feels inefficient. Generates a manifest mapping task-contexts to knowledge chunks, optimizes information density, and creates compiled artifacts for efficient agent consumption.
