Research a UI design aesthetic and produce exhaustive, implementation-ready design guidelines for coding agents. Use when the user names an aesthetic (brutalist, glassmorphism, retro-futuristic, Swiss modernist, Apple HIG, neumorphism, minimalism, cyberpunk, Material Design, art deco, vaporwave, etc.) and wants a complete style guide with exact CSS values, color palettes, component states, animations, and typography — detailed enough for a coding agent to faithfully implement the aesthetic with zero ambiguity.
