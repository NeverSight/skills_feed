Design intuitive, meaningful interactions grounded in user goals and cognitive principles. Use when designing component behaviors, user flows, feedback systems, error handling, loading states, transitions, accessibility, keyboard navigation, touch/gesture interactions, or when evaluating interaction quality. Also use for modal vs modeless decisions, direct manipulation patterns, input device considerations, emotional/dramatic aspects of UX, or when asked about making interfaces feel responsive, humane, and goal-directed.
