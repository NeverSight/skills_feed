Guided Shape Up workflow for taking projects from idea to working software. Orchestrates the /shaping and /breadboarding skills through a structured process: Frame, Shape, Breadboard, Slice, Build. Works for both greenfield (0-1) and existing projects. Use when: starting a new project or feature, planning a significant change to an existing codebase, user says "shape this", "let's shape", "shape up", or wants to go from idea to implementation with structured problem/solution separation. Proactively guides each phase and suggests next steps.
