Generate comprehensive implementation tutorial documents with deep background, context, rationale, and step-by-step milestones. Use when the user wants to learn by building—creating detailed guides instead of making direct code changes. Triggers on requests like "create a tutorial for", "implementation guide", "teach me how to implement", or explicit /tutorial invocation.
