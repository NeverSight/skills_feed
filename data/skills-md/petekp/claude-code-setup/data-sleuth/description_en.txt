Identify non-obvious signals, hidden patterns, and clever correlations in datasets using investigative data analysis techniques. Use when analyzing social media exports, user data, behavioral datasets, or any structured data where deeper insights are desired. Pairs with personality-profiler for enhanced signal extraction. Triggers on requests like "what patterns do you see", "find hidden signals", "correlate these datasets", "what am I missing in this data", "analyze across datasets", "find non-obvious insights", or when users want to go beyond surface-level analysis. Also use proactively when you notice interesting anomalies or correlations during any data analysis task.
