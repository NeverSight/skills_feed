Expertise in architecting, implementing, reviewing, and debugging hierarchical matching systems. Use when working with: (1) Two-sided matching (Gale-Shapley, hospital-resident, student-school), (2) Assignment/optimization problems (Hungarian algorithm, bipartite matching), (3) Multi-level hierarchy matching (org charts, taxonomies, nested categories), (4) Entity resolution and record linkage across hierarchies. Triggers: debugging match quality issues, reviewing matching algorithms, translating business requirements into constraints, validating match correctness, architecting new matching systems, fixing unstable matches, resolving constraint violations, diagnosing preference misalignment.
