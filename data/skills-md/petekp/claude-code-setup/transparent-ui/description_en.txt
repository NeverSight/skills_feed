Create standalone debugging interfaces that reveal the internal workings of complex systems through interactive visualization. Use when the user wants to understand how something works, debug internal state, visualize data flow, see what happens when they interact with the system, or build a debug panel for any complex mechanism. Triggers on requests like "I don't understand how this works", "show me what's happening", "visualize the state machine", "build a debug view for this", "help me see the data flow", "make this transparent", or any request to understand, debug, or visualize internal system behavior. Applies to state machines, rendering systems, event flows, algorithms, animations, data pipelines, CSS calculations, database queries, or any system with non-obvious internal workings.
