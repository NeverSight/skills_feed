Assess a codebase's readiness for autonomous agent development and provide tailored recommendations. Use when asked to evaluate how well a project supports unattended agent execution, assess development practices for agent autonomy, audit infrastructure for agent reliability, or improve a codebase for autonomous agent workflows. Triggers on requests like "assess this project for agent readiness", "how autonomous-ready is this codebase", "evaluate agent infrastructure", or "improve development practices for agents".
