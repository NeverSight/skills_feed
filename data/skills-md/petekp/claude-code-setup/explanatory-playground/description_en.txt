Build interactive debugging interfaces that reveal internal system behavior. Use when asked to "help me understand how this works", "show me what's happening", "visualize the state", "build a debug view", "I can't see what's going on", or any request to make opaque system behavior visible. Applies to state machines, data flow, event systems, algorithms, render cycles, animations, CSS calculations, or any mechanism with hidden internals.
