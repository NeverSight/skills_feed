Perform comprehensive, deep analysis of a system and its subsystems to identify bugs, race conditions, stale documentation, dead code, and correctness issues. Use when asked to "audit this system", "exhaustive analysis of X", "analyze for correctness", "root out issues in...", "deep dive into...", "verify this code is correct", "find bugs in...", or when reviewing agent-written code for production readiness. Automatically decomposes systems into subsystems, applies appropriate analysis checklists, and produces structured findings with severity classification.
