Facilitate methodical review of proposals (technical designs, product specs, feature requests). Use when asked to "review this proposal", "give feedback on this doc", "help me review this RFC", or when presented with a document that needs structured feedback. Handles markdown files, GitHub gists/issues/PRs, and other text formats. Chunks proposals intelligently, predicts reviewer reactions, and produces feedback adapted to the proposal's format.
