Standard flow from any task source (link or description) to creating a PR: resolve task, create branch and TODO.md, wait for fixes, create PR against origin only. Use find-skills to discover data-source query methods; after confirmation save to global config so the discovery step can be skipped next time. Use when the user provides a task link/description, asks to 'follow GitHub workflow', or 'create PR from task'.
