Creates Agent Skills from an arbitrary repository when no existing reference exists. Clones the repo to .temp/repos, generates skills under a user-defined name following project conventions, iterates until major modules are covered, then removes the temp clone. Use when the user provides a repo URL and a skills name to bootstrap skills for a framework or project.
