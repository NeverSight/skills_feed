Transform vague product or feature ideas into concrete, detailed specification documents through an interactive interview process. Use when the user wants to flesh out an idea, create a spec, write requirements, plan a product/feature/prototype, or go from "I have this idea..." to a concrete document. Works for software products, physical products, services, or any concept that needs specification.
