Reimplement the current branch on a new branch with a clean, narrative-quality git commit history. Use when the user wants to clean up messy commits, create a tutorial-style commit history, or prepare a branch for review with logical, self-contained commits. Triggers on requests like "clean up my commits", "reimplement this branch", "create a clean history", or "make my commits reviewable".
