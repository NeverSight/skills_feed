Create and maintain first-party custom skills by strategically consolidating overlapping third-party skills. Scans globally installed skills (prefer ~/.agents/skills, or $CODEX_HOME/skills, or ~/.codex/skills) to produce an overlap report, then guides merging into a smaller, linked set inside this repo’s `skills/` directory. Use when asked to "clean up skills", "merge skills", "remove duplicates", "consolidate overlapping skills", "organize my skills", or "create a custom skill from other skills".
