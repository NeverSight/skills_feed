Use when needing to look up book content inside **my own Amazon (Kindle) book library** (purchases + any personal docs), find a book by title/author, download an ebook I own (where Amazon permits), or reference material from a published book I’ve purchased. Triggers on book lookups, ebook downloads, "find the book", "get the PDF/EPUB of" **from my library**. Downloads produce PDF/EPUB/MOBI files (and may include Kindle formats depending on the title) - use ebook-extractor skill to convert to text.
