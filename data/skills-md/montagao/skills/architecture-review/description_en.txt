Review system architecture with an indie hacker lens - bias toward shipping, YAGNI/KISS, fewer moving parts. Invoke as "/architecture-review [path/to/plan]" to roast a plan directory containing overview.md, phases/, and reference/ docs. Use when asked to "review architecture", "roast my design", "check for over-engineering", or "simplify this system".
