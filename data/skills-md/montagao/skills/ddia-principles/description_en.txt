Apply principles from "Designing Data-Intensive Applications" (Kleppmann) to system design, architecture review, and technology selection. Use when (1) designing new data systems or APIs, (2) choosing between databases, queues, or storage technologies, (3) reviewing architecture for reliability, scalability, or consistency concerns, (4) discussing trade-offs in distributed systems, (5) reviewing code for data handling patterns. Optimized for startup/small team contexts where pragmatic choices matter.
