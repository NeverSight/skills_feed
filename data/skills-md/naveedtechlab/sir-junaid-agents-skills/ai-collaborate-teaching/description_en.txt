Design learning experiences for AI-native software development, integrating the Three Roles Framework 
(AI as Teacher/Student/Co-Worker), co-learning partnership pedagogy, and "Specs Are the New Syntax" 
paradigm into programming curriculum. Use this skill when educators need to prepare students for 
professional AI-driven development workflows, teach effective specification-first collaboration, or 
balance AI assistance with foundational learning goals. This skill helps create lessons that leverage
AI tools appropriately while ensuring students build independent capability, bidirectional learning
patterns, and ethical AI use practices. Aligned with Constitution v4.0.1.
