Pattern extraction framework for learning from sessions. This skill captures valuable patterns discovered during work sessions including error resolutions, user corrections, workarounds, debugging techniques, and project-specific patterns. Triggers on Stop hook, end of session, "save learnings", "extract patterns", or when explicitly asked to capture knowledge from the current session. Outputs learned skills to ~/.claude/skills/learned/.
