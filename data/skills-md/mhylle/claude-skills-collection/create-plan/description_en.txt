Create detailed implementation plans through interactive research and iteration. This skill should be used when creating new implementation plans, designing feature specifications, planning technical work, or when the user asks to plan an implementation. Triggers on requests like "create a plan", "plan the implementation", "design how to implement", or when given a feature/task that needs structured planning before implementation.
