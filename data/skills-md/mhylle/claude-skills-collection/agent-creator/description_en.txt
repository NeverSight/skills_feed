Create composable AI agent systems in NestJS projects following the "tools all the way down" architecture. Use this skill when users want to: (1) Create new AI agents with orchestrator/planner/executor/evaluator components, (2) Build agentic systems that can call other agents as tools, (3) Implement DAG-based planning with parallel execution, (4) Add database-backed state persistence for agent runs, (5) Create custom evaluators for quality assurance. Triggers on "create agent", "build agent", "agent system", "agentic", "orchestrator", "planner/executor pattern", or NestJS AI agent requests.
