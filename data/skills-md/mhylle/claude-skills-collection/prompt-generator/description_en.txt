Generate implementation prompts for phase-based project execution using an orchestration pattern. Use when users request prompts for implementing project phases, need orchestration prompts for multi-step implementations, ask for "/prompt", "generate prompt", "create implementation prompt", or want to create structured implementation instructions for subagent delegation. Outputs the prompt to chat and saves to docs/prompts folder.
