Comprehensive E2E testing skill using Playwright MCP for systematic web application testing. This skill should be used when users need to test web-based systems end-to-end, set up test regimes, run exploratory tests, or analyze test history. Triggers on requests like "test my webapp", "set up E2E tests", "run the tests", "what's been flaky", or when validating web application functionality. The skill observes and reports only - it never fixes issues. Supports three modes - setup (create test regime), run (execute tests), and report (analyze results).
