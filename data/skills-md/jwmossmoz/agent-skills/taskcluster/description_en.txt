Interact with Mozilla Taskcluster CI using the taskcluster CLI. Query task status, view logs, download artifacts, retrigger tasks, and manage task groups. Use when working with CI tasks from firefox-ci-tc.services.mozilla.com or debugging worker pool issues. For worker pool operations (list workers, terminate workers, bulk task cancellation), use native taskcluster api commands (see references/worker-pools.md). Triggers on "taskcluster", "task status", "task log", "artifacts", "retrigger", "task group", "worker pool".
