Document-driven development with test-gated progression. Enforces a disciplined workflow: plan tasks with the user in .hype/TODO.md, document before implementing, track progress in .hype/PROGRESS.md, accumulate project knowledge in .hype/KNOWLEDGE.md, and require all tests to pass before advancing. Language-agnostic — works with any programming language or even non-code projects. Use when: (1) starting new projects with structured planning, (2) implementing features or bug fixes with mandatory test verification, (3) managing development tasks with document-based tracking, (4) the user mentions "hype", "document-driven development", "TODO tracking", or wants a disciplined plan-document-implement-test cycle.
