Omniscient zero-iteration debugging protocol. Triggers: debug, fix bug, error, crash, failing test, broken code, not working, exception, stack trace, troubleshoot, diagnose issue. Produces: Single surgical fix with 100% certainty. BLOCKS code changes until root cause proven. Eliminates guess-and-check loops entirely.
