Create and update structured project status reports from meetings, messages, documents, or notes. Use when users need to extract status updates into markdown reports with summary, problems, risks, and actions sections, consolidate multiple team reports, update existing reports maintaining reverse chronological order, save/modify reports in Obsidian vault, or mention terms like "status report", "project update", "sync", "war room", "team report", or "weekly update".
