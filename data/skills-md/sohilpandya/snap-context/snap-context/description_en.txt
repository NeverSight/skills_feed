Analyze, describe, read, or extract content from any screenshot, image, photo, picture, pic, snap, screen grab, or screen capture the user shares. Triggers when users ask about images ("what's in this", "what can you see", "what does this show", "what am I looking at", "tell me about this", "can you read this"), request review ("check this", "look at this", "review these", "analyze this"), request extraction ("extract text", "convert to markdown", "transcribe this", "parse this", "pull the data"), or describe attachments ("here's a screenshot", "I pasted this", "see attached"). Works with single or multiple images. Converts UI data into clean, structured markdown.
