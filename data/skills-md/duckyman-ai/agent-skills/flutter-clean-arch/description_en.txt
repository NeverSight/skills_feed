Generate Flutter applications using Clean Architecture with feature-first structure, Riverpod state management, Dio + Retrofit for networking, and fpdart error handling. Use this skill when creating Flutter apps, implementing features with clean architecture patterns, setting up Riverpod providers, handling data with Either type for functional error handling, making HTTP requests with type-safe API clients, or structuring projects with domain/data/presentation layers. Triggers include "Flutter app", "clean architecture", "Riverpod", "feature-first", "state management", "API client", "Retrofit", "Dio", "REST API", or requests to build Flutter features with separation of concerns.
