React component library skill for shadcn/ui + Tailwind CSS. Use for React/Next.js/Vite projects needing accessible UI components (dialogs, forms, tables, navigation), Radix UI primitives, Tailwind utility styling, theming, and dark mode. NOT for Angular projects - see frontend-angular-* skills. Triggers on "shadcn", "radix ui", "react components", "tailwind components". For design decisions (styles, palettes, fonts), use ui-ux-pro-max instead.
