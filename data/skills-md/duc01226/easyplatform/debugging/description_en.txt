Systematic debugging framework for root cause investigation before fixes. Use for bugs, test failures, unexpected behavior, performance issues. Use `--autonomous` flag for structured headless debugging with approval gates. Triggers: debug, bug, error, fix, diagnose, root cause, stack trace, investigate issue. NOT for: code review (use code-review), simplification (use code-simplifier).
