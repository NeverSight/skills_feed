This skill should be used when working on Godot Engine projects. It provides specialized knowledge of Godot's file formats (.gd, .tscn, .tres), architecture patterns (component-based, signal-driven, resource-based), common pitfalls, validation tools, code templates, and CLI workflows. The `godot` command is available for running the game, validating scripts, importing resources, and exporting builds. Use this skill for tasks involving Godot game development, debugging scene/resource files, implementing game systems, or creating new Godot components.
