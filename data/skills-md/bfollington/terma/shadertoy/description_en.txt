This skill should be used when working with Shadertoy shaders, GLSL fragment shaders, or creating procedural graphics for the web. Use when writing .glsl files, implementing visual effects, creating generative art, or working with WebGL shader code. This skill provides GLSL ES syntax reference, common shader patterns, and Shadertoy-specific conventions.
