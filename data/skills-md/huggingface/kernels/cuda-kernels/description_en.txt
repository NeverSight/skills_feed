Provides guidance for writing and benchmarking optimized CUDA kernels for NVIDIA GPUs (H100, A100, T4) targeting HuggingFace diffusers and transformers libraries. Supports models like LTX-Video, Stable Diffusion, LLaMA, Mistral, and Qwen. Includes integration with HuggingFace Kernels Hub (get_kernel) for loading pre-compiled kernels. Includes benchmarking scripts to compare kernel performance against baseline implementations.
