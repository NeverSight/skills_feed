Semantic code search using mgrep for efficient codebase exploration. This skill should be used when searching or exploring codebases with more than 30 non-gitignored files and/or nested directory structures. It provides natural language semantic search that complements traditional grep/ripgrep for finding features, understanding intent, and exploring unfamiliar code.
