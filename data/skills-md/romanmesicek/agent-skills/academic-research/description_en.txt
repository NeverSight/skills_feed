Systematic academic literature search with source prioritization and APA 7th edition citations.
Use when the user needs to research a topic with scholarly sources, verify claims with academic
backing, find peer-reviewed evidence, compile research findings, or generate properly cited reports.
Triggers: "research [topic]", "what does the research say about...", "find studies on...",
"verify this claim...", "literature review", "academic sources for...", "peer-reviewed evidence",
"scholarly articles about...", "evidence-based", "cite sources for...". This skill provides
basic APA citation capabilities; for advanced citation work (complex source types, edge cases,
batch formatting), consider the `apa-style-citation` skill which offers enhanced citation expertise.
