Fix and optimize images in uncommitted blog posts. Use when preparing blog posts for publication, fixing broken image paths, renaming generic image names (image.png), moving images to proper /images/blog/ directory, improving alt text, or checking image references before committing. Trigger on "fix blog images", "check images", "prepare post for publish", or after pasting screenshots into markdown.
