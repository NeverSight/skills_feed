Iterative refinement, parameter optimization, and ML enhancement of existing trading strategies. Provides 3 tools: refine_strategy (targeted code changes, $0.50-$3.00), optimize_strategy (parameter tuning, $2-$4), enhance_with_allora (ML integration, $1-$2.50). More cost-effective than regenerating from scratch. Use when you have working strategies that need improvement. Always test improvements with test-trading-strategies before deploying.
