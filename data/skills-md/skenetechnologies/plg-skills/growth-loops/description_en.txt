When the user wants to design, map, or quantitatively model growth loops -- including viral, content, paid, or sales loops. Also use when the user says "growth flywheel," "compounding growth," "loop modeling," "S-curve sequencing," or "growth engine." For viral-specific loop design, see viral-loops. For quantitative forecasting, see growth-modeling.
