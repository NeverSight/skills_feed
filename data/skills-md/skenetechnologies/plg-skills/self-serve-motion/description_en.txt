When the user wants to reduce friction in the self-serve buying experience, optimize in-product checkout, remove "contact sales" gates, or design self-serve onboarding and support. Also use when the user says "frictionless," "self-service," "remove sales gates," "no-demo experience," or "friction audit." For signup flow optimization, see signup-flow-cro. For pricing page design, see pricing-strategy.
