When the user wants to optimize a signup or registration flow -- including field selection, social auth, single-step vs multi-step forms, or mobile signup. Also use when the user says "signup conversion," "registration form," "reduce signup friction," "signup A/B test," or "signup drop-off." For post-signup onboarding, see product-onboarding. For activation measurement, see activation-metrics.
