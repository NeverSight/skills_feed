When the user wants to layer sales onto a PLG motion, build PQL scoring, design sales handoffs from product usage signals, or plan a hybrid PLG + sales model. Also use when the user says "product-led sales," "PQL," "PQA," "when to add sales to PLG," or "enterprise PLG." For broader PLG strategy, see plg-strategy. For expansion revenue, see expansion-revenue.
