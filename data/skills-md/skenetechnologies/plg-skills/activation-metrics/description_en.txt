When the user wants to define, measure, or optimize user activation -- including identifying the aha moment, measuring time-to-value, or building an activation funnel. Also use when the user says "activation rate," "aha moment," "setup moment," "habit moment," "time to value," or "how do I measure activation." For onboarding design, see product-onboarding. For retention, see retention-analysis.
