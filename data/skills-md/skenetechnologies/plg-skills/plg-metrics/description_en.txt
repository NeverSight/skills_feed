When the user wants to define PLG metrics, build a growth dashboard, or set KPI targets -- including activation rate, free-to-paid conversion, NRR, or North Star metric. Also use when the user says "PLG dashboard," "growth KPIs," "metric definitions," or "PLG benchmarks." For activation-specific metrics, see activation-metrics. For analytics setup, see product-analytics.
