When the user needs mental models or frameworks for PLG decisions -- including product-channel fit, time-to-value, network effects, habit loops, or pricing psychology. Also use when the user asks "what framework should I use," "how should I think about this," or references a specific model like "adjacent user theory" or "bowling alley framework." For comprehensive PLG strategy, see plg-strategy. For growth loops, see growth-loops.
