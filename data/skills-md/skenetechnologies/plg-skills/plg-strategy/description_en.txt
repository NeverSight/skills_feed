When the user wants to assess PLG readiness, design a product-led growth strategy, choose between freemium and free trial, evaluate PLG maturity, or plan a hybrid PLG + sales model. Also use when the user says "should we do PLG," "PLG vs sales-led," "growth motions," "PLG audit," or "go-to-market strategy." For specific mental models, see plg-mental-models. For growth loop design, see growth-loops.
