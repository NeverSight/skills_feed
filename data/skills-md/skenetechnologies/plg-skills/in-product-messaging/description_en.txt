When the user wants to design in-product messages -- including tooltips, banners, modals, slideouts, or notification bells -- without annoying users. Also use when the user says "in-app messages," "product announcements," "nudges," "contextual help," or "message frequency." For upgrade prompts specifically, see paywall-upgrade-cro. For feature launches, see feature-adoption.
