Comprehensive guide for Deep Learning with Keras 3 (Multi-Backend: JAX, TensorFlow, PyTorch). Use when building neural networks, CNNs for computer vision, RNNs/Transformers for NLP, time series forecasting, or generative models (VAEs, GANs). Covers model building (Sequential/Functional/Subclassing APIs), custom training loops, data augmentation, transfer learning, and production best practices.
