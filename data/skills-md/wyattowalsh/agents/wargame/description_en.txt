Domain-agnostic strategic decision analysis and wargaming. Auto-classifies scenario complexity: simple decisions get structured analysis (pre-mortem, ACH, decision trees); complex or adversarial scenarios get full multi-turn interactive wargames with AI-controlled actors, Monte Carlo outcome exploration, and structured adjudication. Generates visual dashboards and saves markdown decision journals. Use for business strategy, crisis management, competitive analysis, geopolitical scenarios, personal decisions, or any consequential choice under uncertainty.
