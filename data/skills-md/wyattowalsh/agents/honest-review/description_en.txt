Research-driven code review at multiple abstraction levels with strengths acknowledgment, creative review lenses, AI code smell detection, and severity calibration by project type. Two modes: (1) Session review — review and verify changes using parallel reviewers that research-validate every assumption; (2) Full codebase audit — deep end-to-end evaluation using parallel teams of subagent-spawning reviewers. Use when reviewing changes, verifying work quality, auditing a codebase, validating correctness, checking assumptions, finding defects, reducing complexity. NOT for writing new code, explaining code, or benchmarking.
