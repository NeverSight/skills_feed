Convert complex implementation plans into focused, autonomous agent sprints with measurable acceptance criteria. Use when (1) decomposing a large plan into agent-executable chunks, (2) breaking down multi-endpoint migrations or multi-step projects, (3) creating sprint definitions with acceptance criteria for autonomous agents, (4) planning dependency chains across implementation sprints, or (5) structuring work for parallel agent execution.
