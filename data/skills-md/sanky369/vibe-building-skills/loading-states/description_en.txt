Design effective loading states, skeleton screens, and empty states that maintain user confidence. Use when content takes time to load, when showing progress, or handling empty data scenarios. Triggers on "loading state", "skeleton screen", "empty state", "spinner", "progress bar", "loading animation", "zero state".
