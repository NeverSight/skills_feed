Run structured brainstorming sessions using paired explorer/challenger agent teams. Explorers generate ideas, challengers play devil's advocate, and 2-3 rounds of debate produce pressure-tested proposals. Use when brainstorming product ideas, exploring feature directions, evaluating strategic options, generating milestone candidates, or when the user says "brainstorm", "explore ideas", "what should we build next", "generate options", or "run an ideation session".
