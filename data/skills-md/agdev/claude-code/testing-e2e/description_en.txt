Expert guidance for writing resilient end-to-end tests that span multiple processes and components. Use this skill when reviewing, writing, or refactoring system-wide e2e tests. Covers user-facing scenarios, helper functions, data factories, ARIA-based selectors, and auto-retriable assertions. NOT for unit/integration tests - use testing-unit-integration skill instead. See references/playwright-resilience.md for detailed selector patterns.
