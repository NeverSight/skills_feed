Expert guidance for writing clean, simple, and effective unit, integration, component, microservice, and API tests. Use this skill when reviewing existing tests for violations, writing new tests, or refactoring tests. NOT for end-to-end tests that span multiple processes - use testing-e2e skill instead. Covers AAA pattern, data factories, mocking strategies, DOM testing, database testing, and assertion best practices.
