Research-driven UI/UX improvement using Mobbin. Use when user explicitly requests design pattern research ("use Mobbin", "research design patterns", "find UX patterns for X"). Requires Mobbin account and browser automation (claude-in-chrome MCP). Searches Mobbin for relevant UI patterns, extracts design principles, generates a spec document for approval, then implements. NOT for general UI work—only when user wants research-backed design.
