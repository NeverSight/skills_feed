General-purpose X/Twitter research agent. Searches X for real-time perspectives, dev discussions, product feedback, cultural takes, breaking news, and expert opinions. Works like a web research agent but uses X as the source. Use when: (1) user says "x research", "search x for", "search twitter for", "what are people saying about", "what's twitter saying", "check x for", "x search", "/x-research", (2) user is working on something where recent X discourse would provide useful context (new library releases, API changes, product launches, cultural events, industry drama), (3) user wants to find what devs/experts/community thinks about a topic. NOT for: posting tweets or account management. Note: currently uses recent search (last 7 days). Full-archive search is available on the same pay-per-use X API plan but not yet implemented in this skill.
