Apply the grug brain philosophy to software development - fight complexity, prefer simplicity, and build maintainable code. Use when the user asks to "simplify this code", "is this too complex", "should I abstract this", "review for over-engineering", "grug brain", "keep it simple", or when reviewing code for complexity issues, making architectural decisions, or refactoring code to reduce complexity.
