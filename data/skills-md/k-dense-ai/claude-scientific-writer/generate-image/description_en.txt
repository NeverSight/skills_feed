Generate or edit images using AI models (FLUX, Gemini). Use for general-purpose image generation including photos, illustrations, artwork, visual assets, concept art, and any image that isn't a technical diagram or schematic. For flowcharts, circuits, pathways, and technical diagrams, use the scientific-schematics skill instead.
