Build production-grade FastAPI backends with SQLModel, Dapr integration, and JWT authentication.
Use when building REST APIs with Neon PostgreSQL, implementing event-driven microservices with
Dapr pub/sub, scheduling jobs, or creating CRUD endpoints with JWT/JWKS verification.
NOT when building simple scripts or non-microservice architectures.
