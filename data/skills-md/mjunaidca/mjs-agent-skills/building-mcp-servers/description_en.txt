Guides creation of high-quality MCP (Model Context Protocol) servers that enable LLMs
to interact with external services through well-designed tools. Use when building MCP
servers to integrate external APIs or services, whether in Python (FastMCP) or
Node/TypeScript (MCP SDK). Covers tool design, authentication, Docker deployment,
and evaluation creation. NOT when consuming existing MCP servers (use the server directly).
