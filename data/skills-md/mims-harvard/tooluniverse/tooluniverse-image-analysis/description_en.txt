Production-ready microscopy image analysis and quantitative imaging data skill for colony morphometry, cell counting, fluorescence quantification, and statistical analysis of imaging-derived measurements. Processes ImageJ/CellProfiler output (area, circularity, intensity, cell counts), performs Dunnett's test, Cohen's d effect size, power analysis, Shapiro-Wilk normality tests, two-way ANOVA, polynomial regression, natural spline regression with confidence intervals, and comparative morphometry. Supports CSV/TSV measurement tables, multi-channel fluorescence data, colony swarming assays, and neuron counting datasets. Use when analyzing microscopy measurement data, colony area/circularity, cell count statistics, swarming assays, co-culture ratio optimization, or answering questions about imaging-derived quantitative data.
