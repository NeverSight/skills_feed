# Clinical Trial Design Feasibility Assessment

Systematically assess clinical trial feasibility by analyzing 6 research dimensions. Produces comprehensive feasibility reports with quantitative enrollment projections, endpoint recommendations, and regulatory pathway analysis.

**IMPORTANT**: Always use English terms in tool calls (drug names, disease names, biomarker names), even if the user writes in another language. Only try original-language terms as a fallback if English returns no results. Respond in the user's language.

## Core Principles

### 1. Report-First Approach (MANDATORY)
**DO NOT** show tool outputs to user. Instead:
1. Create `[INDICATION]_trial_feasibility_report.md` FIRST
2. Initialize with all section headers
3. Progressively update as data arrives
4. Present only the final report

### 2. Evidence Grading System

| Grade | Symbol | Criteria | Examples |
|-------|--------|----------|----------|
| **A** | ★★★ | Regulatory acceptance, multiple precedents | FDA-approved endpoint in same indication |
| **B** | ★★☆ | Clinical validation, single precedent | Phase 3 trial in related indication |
| **C** | ★☆☆ | Preclinical or exploratory | Phase 1 use, biomarker validation ongoing |
| **D** | ☆☆☆ | Proposed, no validation | Novel endpoint, no precedent |

### 3. Feasibility Score (0-100)
Weighted composite score:
- **Patient Availability** (30%): Population size × biomarker prevalence × geography
- **Endpoint Precedent** (25%): Historical use, regulatory acceptance
- **Regulatory Clarity** (20%): Pathway defined, precedents exist
- **Comparator Feasibility** (15%): Standard of care availability
- **Safety Monitoring** (10%): Known risks, monitoring established

## When to Use This Skill

Apply when users:
- Plan early-phase trials (Phase 1/2 emphasis)
- Need enrollment feasibility assessment
- Design biomarker-selected trials
- Evaluate endpoint strategies
- Assess regulatory pathways
- Compare trial design options
- Need safety monitoring plans

**Trigger phrases**: "clinical trial design", "trial feasibility", "enrollment projections", "endpoint selection", "trial planning", "Phase 1/2 design", "basket trial", "biomarker trial"

## Quick Start

```python
from tooluniverse import ToolUniverse

tu = ToolUniverse(use_cache=True)
tu.load_tools()

# Example: EGFR+ NSCLC trial feasibility
indication = "EGFR-mutant non-small cell lung cancer"
biomarker = "EGFR L858R"

# Step 1: Get disease prevalence
disease_info = tu.tools.OpenTargets_get_disease_id_description_by_name(
    diseaseName="non-small cell lung cancer"
)

prevalence = tu.tools.OpenTargets_get_diseases_phenotypes(
    efoId=disease_info['data']['id']
)

# Step 2: Estimate biomarker prevalence
# EGFR mutations: ~15% of NSCLC in US, ~50% in Asia
variants = tu.tools.ClinVar_search_variants(
    gene="EGFR",
    significance="pathogenic"
)

# Step 3: Find precedent trials
trials = tu.tools.search_clinical_trials(
    condition="EGFR positive non-small cell lung cancer",
    status="completed",
    phase="2"
)

# Step 4: Identify standard of care comparator
soc_drugs = tu.tools.FDA_OrangeBook_search_drugs(
    ingredient="osimertinib"  # Current SOC for EGFR+ NSCLC
)

# Compile into feasibility report...
```

### 14. Recommendations & Next Steps
```markdown
## 14.1 Final Recommendation
**GO / CONDITIONAL GO / NO-GO**: [Decision]

**Rationale**:
[2-3 paragraphs synthesizing feasibility analysis. Example:]

This trial demonstrates HIGH feasibility (score: 82/100) for the following reasons:
1. **Patient availability is strong** (★★★): EGFR+ NSCLC affects ~18,000 US patients/year,
   with L858R representing 45% (8,100 patients). With 20 sites, enrollment of N=43 is
   achievable in 8-10 months.
2. **Endpoint precedent is robust** (★★★): ORR is FDA-accepted for accelerated approval
   in NSCLC (18 precedents since 2015). RECIST 1.1 is standard, feasible.
3. **Regulatory pathway is clear** (★★☆): 505(b)(1) with breakthrough therapy potential
   given 2x ORR improvement vs. SOC. Pre-IND meeting advised to confirm single-arm design.

**Key Risk**: Enrollment may slow if sites lack rapid EGFR testing. Mitigation: Central
liquid biopsy with 7-day turnaround.

## 14.2 Critical Path to IND
**Immediate Next Steps** (Months 0-3):
- [ ] Request pre-IND meeting with FDA (target Month 1)
- [ ] Initiate CDx partnership for [biomarker] test (FDA clearance path)
- [ ] Secure drug supply (GMP manufacturing, stability)
- [ ] Draft protocol (v1.0) and ICF
- [ ] Site feasibility surveys (target [M] sites)

**IND Preparation** (Months 3-6):
- [ ] Complete CMC section (drug substance/product, manufacturing)
- [ ] Finalize preclinical package (toxicology, pharmacology)
- [ ] Prepare clinical protocol (incorporate FDA feedback)
- [ ] Develop CRFs and EDC database
- [ ] IND submission (Month 6)

**Post-IND** (Months 6-9):
- [ ] IRB submissions (central IRB for multi-site)
- [ ] Site contracts and budgets
- [ ] Investigator meeting
- [ ] First patient enrolled (Month 7-8)

## 14.3 Alternative Designs (If Current Design Infeasible)
**Plan B**: [If enrollment too slow]
- Broaden biomarker criteria (e.g., all EGFR mutations, not just L858R)
- Add international sites (Asia, EU)
- Basket design (multiple cancers with EGFR mutations)

**Plan C**: [If single-arm rejected by FDA]
- Randomized Phase 2 (1:1 vs. SOC)
- Increase sample size to N=86 (43/arm)
- Requires 2x sites and budget

## 14.4 Long-Term Development Strategy
**If Phase 2 Successful**:
- Phase 3 design: Randomized, OS primary endpoint, N=300-500
- Companion diagnostic (CDx): Parallel FDA submission
- Commercial readiness: Manufacturing scale-up
- Patent strategy: File composition-of-matter or method-of-use

**Market Considerations**:
- Addressable market: [8,100 EGFR L858R NSCLC patients/year in US]
- Competitive landscape: [Osimertinib, other EGFR TKIs]
- Differentiation: [e.g., Activity against T790M resistance]
- Pricing: [$10-15K/month based on comparators]
```

## Best Practices

### 1. Start with Report Template
Create full report structure FIRST, then populate:
```markdown
# Clinical Trial Feasibility Report: [INDICATION]
## 1. Executive Summary
[Researching...]
## 2. Disease Background
[Researching...]
[...all 14 sections...]
```

### 2. Use English for All Tool Calls
Even if user asks in another language:
- "EGFR+ NSCLC" not "EGFR+ 非小细胞肺癌"
- "breast cancer" not "cancer du sein"
- Translate results back to user's language

### 3. Validate Biomarker Prevalence Across Sources
Cross-check ClinVar, gnomAD, COSMIC, and literature:
- ClinVar: Clinical significance
- gnomAD: Population frequency (for germline)
- COSMIC: Somatic mutation frequency in cancers
- Literature: Geographic/ethnic variation

### 4. Calculate Enrollment Funnel Explicitly
Show math for patient availability:
```
US NSCLC incidence: 200,000/year
× EGFR+ prevalence: 15% = 30,000
× L858R within EGFR+: 45% = 13,500
× Eligible (age, PS, prior Tx): 60% = 8,100
÷ Competing trials: 3 = 2,700 available/year

For N=43, need 43/2,700 = 1.6% capture rate → Achievable
```

### 5. Evidence Grade Every Key Claim
```markdown
EGFR L858R prevalence is 45% of EGFR+ NSCLC [★★★: PMID:12345, large
sequencing study n=1,500]. *Source: ClinVar, COSMIC*
```

### 6. Provide Regulatory Precedent Details
Not just "ORR is accepted" but:
```markdown
ORR is FDA-accepted for accelerated approval in NSCLC [★★★: FDA approvals]:
- Osimertinib (2015): ORR 57%, n=411, Tx-resistant EGFR+ (NCT01802632)
- Dacomitinib (2018): ORR 45%, n=452, 1L EGFR+ (NCT01774721)
- [3 more examples]
```

### 7. Address Feasibility Risks Proactively
For each HIGH risk, provide mitigation:
```markdown
Risk: Biomarker screen failure rate >70%
→ Mitigation: Liquid biopsy pre-screening (ctDNA EGFR, 7-day turnaround)
```

### 8. Separate Phase 1 and Phase 2 Components
If combined Phase 1/2:
- Phase 1: Safety, DLT, RP2D (N=12-18, 3+3 or BOIN)
- Phase 2: Efficacy, ORR (N=43, Simon 2-stage)
- Distinct success criteria for each phase

## Common Pitfalls to Avoid

### ❌ Don't: Show Tool Outputs to User
```markdown
# BAD
OpenTargets returned:
{
  "data": {
    "id": "EFO_0003060",
    "name": "non-small cell lung carcinoma"
  }
}
```

### ✅ Do: Present Synthesized Report
```markdown
# GOOD
## Disease Background
Non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) represents 85% of lung cancers, with
~200,000 new cases annually in the US [★★★: CDC WONDER]. EGFR mutations
occur in 15% of Caucasian and 50% of Asian patients [★★★: PMID:23816960].
*Source: OpenTargets, ClinVar*
```

### ❌ Don't: Make Unsupported Claims
```markdown
# BAD
ORR of 60% is expected based on preclinical data.
```

### ✅ Do: Ground in Evidence
```markdown
# GOOD
ORR of 30-40% is projected [★★☆] based on:
- Similar EGFR TKI (erlotinib): 32% ORR in EGFR+ NSCLC (NCT00949650)
- Our drug's 2× IC50 potency vs. erlotinib (preclinical)
*Source: ClinicalTrials.gov, internal data*
```

### ❌ Don't: Ignore Geographic Variation
```markdown
# BAD
EGFR L858R prevalence: 7% of NSCLC
```

### ✅ Do: Specify Geography
```markdown
# GOOD
EGFR L858R prevalence [★★★: COSMIC, ClinVar]:
- Caucasian (US/EU): 6-7% of NSCLC
- East Asian: 20-25% of NSCLC
→ Trial site strategy: Include Asian sites for 2× enrollment
```

## Output Format Requirements

### Report File Naming
- `[INDICATION]_trial_feasibility_report.md`
- Example: `EGFR_L858R_NSCLC_trial_feasibility_report.md`

### Section Completeness
All 14 sections MUST be present:
1. Executive Summary
2. Disease Background
3. Patient Population Analysis (with funnel)
4. Biomarker Strategy
5. Endpoint Selection & Justification
6. Comparator Analysis
7. Safety Endpoints & Monitoring Plan
8. Study Design Recommendations
9. Enrollment & Site Strategy
10. Regulatory Pathway
11. Budget & Resource Considerations
12. Risk Assessment
13. Success Criteria & Go/No-Go Decision (with scorecard)
14. Recommendations & Next Steps

### Evidence Grading Required In
- Section 1 (Executive Summary): Key findings
- Section 4 (Biomarker): Prevalence claims
- Section 5 (Endpoints): Regulatory precedents
- Section 6 (Comparator): SOC efficacy data
- Section 7 (Safety): Toxicity frequencies
- Section 10 (Regulatory): Approval precedents
- Section 13 (Scorecard): All dimensions

### Feasibility Score Transparency
Show calculation:
```markdown
| Dimension | Weight | Raw Score | Weighted | Evidence |
|-----------|--------|-----------|----------|----------|
| Patient Availability | 30% | 8/10 | 24 | ★★★: Epi data |
| Endpoint Precedent | 25% | 9/10 | 22.5 | ★★★: FDA approvals |
| Regulatory Clarity | 20% | 7/10 | 14 | ★★☆: Pre-IND advised |
| Comparator Feasibility | 15% | 9/10 | 13.5 | ★★★: Generic avail |
| Safety Monitoring | 10% | 8/10 | 8 | ★★☆: Class effects |
| **TOTAL** | **100%** | - | **82/100** | **HIGH** |
```

## Example Use Cases

### Use Case 1: Biomarker-Selected Oncology Trial
**Query**: "Assess feasibility of Phase 2 trial for EGFR L858R+ NSCLC, ORR primary endpoint"

**Workflow**:
1. Disease prevalence: 200K NSCLC/year × 15% EGFR+ = 30K
2. Biomarker: L858R is 45% of EGFR+ → 13.5K/year
3. Eligible: 60% → 8K/year
4. Endpoint: ORR accepted (osimertinib precedent)
5. Comparator: Osimertinib (ORR 57%, generic available)
6. Feasibility: HIGH (82/100) → RECOMMEND PROCEED

### Use Case 2: Rare Disease Trial
**Query**: "Feasibility of trial in Niemann-Pick Type C (prevalence 1:120,000)"

**Workflow**:
1. US prevalence: ~2,750 patients total, ~25 new cases/year
2. Endpoint challenge: No validated clinical outcome
3. Orphan drug: QUALIFIED (7-year exclusivity)
4. Comparator: No approved drugs → single-arm feasible
5. Enrollment: Multi-year, need ALL US centers
6. Feasibility: MODERATE (58/100) → CONDITIONAL GO (requires patient registry partnership)

### Use Case 3: Superiority Trial vs. Standard of Care
**Query**: "Phase 2b design for new checkpoint inhibitor vs. pembrolizumab in PD-L1 high NSCLC"

**Workflow**:
1. Patient availability: 40K PD-L1 high NSCLC/year (HIGH)
2. Endpoint: ORR for Phase 2b, plan OS for Phase 3
3. Comparator: Pembrolizumab (ORR 45%, PFS 10mo) - readily available
4. Design: Randomized 1:1, N=120 (60/arm) for 20% ORR improvement
5. Feasibility: HIGH (78/100) → RECOMMEND PROCEED

### Use Case 4: Non-Inferiority Trial
**Query**: "Non-inferiority trial for oral anticoagulant vs. warfarin"

**Workflow**:
1. Patient availability: 2M AFib patients, 600K on warfarin (HIGH)
2. Endpoint: Stroke/SE (FDA-accepted, but requires large N)
3. Non-inferiority margin: HR <1.5 (FDA guidance)
4. Sample size: N=5,000+ for 90% power → LARGE trial
5. Comparator: Warfarin generic, INR monitoring standard
6. Feasibility: MODERATE (65/100) - large N drives cost and timeline

### Use Case 5: Basket Trial (Multiple Cancers, One Biomarker)
**Query**: "Basket trial for NTRK fusion+ solid tumors (15 histologies)"

**Workflow**:
1. Patient availability: NTRK fusions rare (<1% across cancers) → Broad screening
2. Biomarker testing: NGS required (FDA-approved FoundationOne CDx)
3. Endpoint: ORR (precedent: larotrectinib approval, ORR 75%, n=55)
4. Design: Single-arm, N=15-20 per histology × 5-10 histologies
5. Regulatory: Tissue-agnostic approval precedent (★★★: pembrolizumab MSI-H)
6. Feasibility: MODERATE (62/100) - enrollment slow but feasible with broad screening
