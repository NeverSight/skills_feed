Analyze metabolomics data including metabolite identification, quantification, pathway analysis, and metabolic flux. Processes LC-MS, GC-MS, NMR data from targeted and untargeted experiments. Performs normalization, statistical analysis, pathway enrichment, metabolite-enzyme integration, and biomarker discovery. Use when analyzing metabolomics datasets, identifying differential metabolites, studying metabolic pathways, integrating with transcriptomics/proteomics, discovering metabolic biomarkers, performing flux balance analysis, or characterizing metabolic phenotypes in disease, drug response, or physiological conditions.
