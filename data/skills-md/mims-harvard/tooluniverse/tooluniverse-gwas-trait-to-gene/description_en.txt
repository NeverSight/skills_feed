Discover genes associated with diseases and traits using GWAS data from the GWAS Catalog (500,000+ associations) and Open Targets Genetics (L2G predictions). Identifies genetic risk factors, prioritizes causal genes via locus-to-gene scoring, and assesses druggability. Use when asked to find genes associated with a disease or trait, discover genetic risk factors, translate GWAS signals to gene targets, or answer questions like "What genes are associated with type 2 diabetes?"
