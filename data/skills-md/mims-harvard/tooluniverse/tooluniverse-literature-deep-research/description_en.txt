Conduct comprehensive literature research with target disambiguation, evidence grading, and structured theme extraction. Creates a detailed report with mandatory completeness checklist, biological model synthesis, and testable hypotheses. For biological targets, resolves official IDs (Ensembl/UniProt), synonyms, naming collisions, and gathers expression/pathway context before literature search. Outputs report-only by default; methodology in separate appendix if requested. Use when users need thorough literature reviews, target profiles, or ask "what does the literature say about X?".
