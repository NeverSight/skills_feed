Analyze spatial transcriptomics data to map gene expression in tissue architecture. Supports 10x Visium, MERFISH, seqFISH, Slide-seq, and imaging-based platforms. Performs spatial clustering, domain identification, cell-cell proximity analysis, spatial gene expression patterns, tissue architecture mapping, and integration with single-cell data. Use when analyzing spatial transcriptomics datasets, studying tissue organization, identifying spatial expression patterns, mapping cell-cell interactions in tissue context, characterizing tumor microenvironment spatial structure, or integrating spatial and single-cell RNA-seq data for comprehensive tissue analysis.
