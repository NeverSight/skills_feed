Integrate and analyze multiple omics datasets (transcriptomics, proteomics, epigenomics, genomics, metabolomics) for systems biology and precision medicine. Performs cross-omics correlation, multi-omics clustering (MOFA+, NMF), pathway-level integration, and sample matching. Coordinates ToolUniverse skills for expression data (RNA-seq), epigenomics (methylation, ChIP-seq), variants (SNVs, CNVs), protein interactions, and pathway enrichment. Use when analyzing multi-omics datasets, performing integrative analysis, discovering multi-omics biomarkers, studying disease mechanisms across molecular layers, or conducting systems biology research that requires coordinated analysis of transcriptome, genome, epigenome, proteome, and metabolome data.
