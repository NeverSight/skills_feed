Production-ready RNA-seq differential expression analysis using PyDESeq2. Performs DESeq2 normalization, dispersion estimation, Wald testing, LFC shrinkage, and result filtering. Handles multi-factor designs, multiple contrasts, batch effects, and integrates with gene enrichment (gseapy) and ToolUniverse annotation tools (UniProt, Ensembl, OpenTargets). Supports CSV/TSV/H5AD input formats and any organism. Use when analyzing RNA-seq count matrices, identifying DEGs, performing differential expression with statistical rigor, or answering questions about gene expression changes.
