Comprehensive structural variant (SV) analysis skill for clinical genomics. Classifies SVs (deletions, duplications, inversions, translocations), assesses pathogenicity using ACMG-adapted criteria, evaluates gene disruption and dosage sensitivity, and provides clinical interpretation with evidence grading. Use when analyzing CNVs, large deletions/duplications, chromosomal rearrangements, or any structural variants requiring clinical interpretation.
