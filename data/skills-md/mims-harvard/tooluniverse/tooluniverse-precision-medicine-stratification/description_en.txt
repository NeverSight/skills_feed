Comprehensive patient stratification for precision medicine by integrating genomic, clinical, and therapeutic data. Given a disease/condition, genomic data (germline variants, somatic mutations, expression), and optional clinical parameters, performs multi-phase analysis across 9 phases covering disease disambiguation, genetic risk assessment, disease-specific molecular stratification, pharmacogenomic profiling, comorbidity/DDI risk, pathway analysis, clinical evidence and guideline mapping, clinical trial matching, and integrated outcome prediction. Generates a quantitative Precision Medicine Risk Score (0-100) with risk tier assignment (Low/Intermediate/High/Very High), treatment algorithm (1st/2nd/3rd line), pharmacogenomic guidance, clinical trial matches, and monitoring plan. Use when clinicians ask about patient risk stratification, treatment selection, prognosis prediction, or personalized therapeutic strategy across cancer, metabolic, cardiovascular, neurological, or rare diseases.
