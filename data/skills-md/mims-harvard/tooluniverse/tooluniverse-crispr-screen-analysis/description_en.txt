Comprehensive analysis of CRISPR knockout/activation screens with gene essentiality scoring, pathway enrichment, functional annotation, and therapeutic target identification. Identifies essential genes, synthetic lethal interactions, and actionable drug targets from pooled or arrayed CRISPR screens. Use when analyzing CRISPR screen data, identifying gene dependencies, or prioritizing hits for validation.
