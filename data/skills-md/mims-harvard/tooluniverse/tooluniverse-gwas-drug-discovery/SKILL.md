# GWAS-to-Drug Target Discovery

Transform genome-wide association studies (GWAS) into actionable drug targets and repurposing opportunities.

## Overview

This skill bridges genetic discoveries from GWAS with drug development by:

1. **Identifying genetic risk factors** - Finding genes associated with diseases
2. **Assessing druggability** - Evaluating which genes can be targeted by drugs
3. **Prioritizing targets** - Ranking candidates by genetic evidence strength
4. **Finding existing drugs** - Discovering approved/investigational compounds
5. **Identifying repurposing opportunities** - Matching drugs to new indications

### Why This Matters

**From Genetics to Therapeutics**: GWAS has identified thousands of disease-associated variants, but most haven't been translated into therapies. This skill accelerates that translation.

**Success Stories**:
- **PCSK9** (cholesterol) → Alirocumab, Evolocumab (approved 2015)
- **IL-6R** (rheumatoid arthritis) → Tocilizumab (approved 2010)
- **CTLA4** (autoimmunity) → Abatacept (approved 2005)
- **CFTR** (cystic fibrosis) → Ivacaftor (approved 2012)

**Genetic Evidence Doubles Success Rate**: Targets with genetic support have 2x higher probability of clinical approval (Nelson et al., Nature Genetics 2015).

## Core Concepts

### 1. GWAS Evidence Strength

Not all genetic associations are equal. Consider:

- **P-value** - Statistical significance (genome-wide: p < 5×10⁻⁸)
- **Effect size (beta/OR)** - Magnitude of genetic effect
- **Replication** - Confirmed in multiple studies
- **Sample size** - Larger studies = more reliable
- **Population diversity** - Validated across ancestries

### 2. Druggability Criteria

A good drug target must be:

- **Accessible** - Protein location allows drug binding (extracellular > intracellular)
- **Modality match** - Target class fits drug type (GPCR → small molecule, receptor → antibody)
- **Tractable** - Binding pocket suitable for drug design
- **Safe** - Minimal off-target effects, not essential in all tissues

### 3. Target Prioritization Framework

**GWAS Evidence (40%)**:
- Multiple independent SNPs = stronger signal
- Functional variants (missense > intronic)
- Tissue-specific expression matches disease

**Druggability (30%)**:
- Known druggable protein family
- Structural data available
- Existing chemical matter

**Clinical Evidence (20%)**:
- Prior safety data
- Validated disease models
- Biomarker availability

**Commercial Factors (10%)**:
- Patent landscape
- Market size
- Competitive positioning

### 4. Drug Repurposing Logic

Repurposing works when:

1. **Shared genetic architecture** - Same gene implicated in multiple diseases
2. **Pathway overlap** - Related biological mechanisms
3. **Opposite effects** - Drug's mechanism counteracts disease pathology
4. **Proven safety** - Approved drug = de-risked

**Example**: Metformin (T2D drug) being tested for:
- Cancer (AMPK activation)
- Aging (mitochondrial effects)
- PCOS (insulin sensitization)

## Workflow Steps

### Step 1: GWAS Gene Discovery

**Input**: Disease/trait name (e.g., "type 2 diabetes", "Alzheimer disease")

**Process**:
- Query GWAS Catalog for associations
- Filter by significance threshold (p < 5×10⁻⁸)
- Map variants to genes (nearest, eQTL, fine-mapping)
- Aggregate evidence across studies

**Output**: List of genes with genetic support

**Tools Used**:
- `gwas_get_associations_for_trait` - Get associations by disease
- `gwas_search_associations` - Flexible search
- `gwas_get_associations_for_snp` - SNP-specific associations
- `OpenTargets_search_gwas_studies_by_disease` - Curated GWAS data
- `OpenTargets_get_variant_credible_sets` - Fine-mapped loci with L2G predictions

### Step 2: Druggability Assessment

**Input**: Gene list from Step 1

**Process**:
- Check target class (GPCR, kinase, ion channel, etc.)
- Assess tractability (antibody, small molecule)
- Evaluate safety (expression profile, essentiality)
- Check for tool compounds or crystal structures

**Output**: Druggability score (0-1) + modality recommendations

**Tools Used**:
- `OpenTargets_get_target_tractability_by_ensemblID` - Druggability assessment
- `OpenTargets_get_target_classes_by_ensemblID` - Target classification
- `OpenTargets_get_target_safety_profile_by_ensemblID` - Safety data
- `OpenTargets_get_target_genomic_location_by_ensemblID` - Genomic context

### Step 3: Target Prioritization

**Input**: Genes with GWAS + druggability data

**Process**:
- Calculate composite score: genetic evidence × druggability
- Rank targets by score
- Add qualitative factors (novelty, competitive landscape)
- Generate target dossiers

**Output**: Ranked list of drug target candidates

**Scoring Formula**:
```
Target Score = (GWAS Score × 0.4) + (Druggability × 0.3) + (Clinical Evidence × 0.2) + (Novelty × 0.1)
```

### Step 4: Existing Drug Search

**Input**: Prioritized target list

**Process**:
- Search drug-target associations (ChEMBL, DGIdb)
- Find approved drugs, clinical candidates, tool compounds
- Get mechanism of action, indication, phase
- Check for off-label use or failed trials

**Output**: Drug-target pairs with development status

**Tools Used**:
- `OpenTargets_get_associated_drugs_by_disease_efoId` - Known drugs for disease
- `OpenTargets_get_drug_mechanisms_of_action_by_chemblId` - Drug MOA
- `ChEMBL_get_target_activities` - Bioactivity data
- `ChEMBL_get_drug_mechanisms` - Drug mechanisms
- `ChEMBL_search_drugs` - Drug search

### Step 5: Clinical Evidence

**Input**: Drug candidates

**Process**:
- Check clinical trial history (ClinicalTrials.gov)
- Review safety profile (FDA labels, adverse events)
- Assess pharmacology (PK/PD, formulation)
- Evaluate regulatory path

**Output**: Clinical risk assessment

**Tools Used**:
- `FDA_get_adverse_reactions_by_drug_name` - Safety data
- `FDA_get_active_ingredient_info_by_drug_name` - Drug composition
- `OpenTargets_get_drug_warnings_by_chemblId` - Drug warnings

### Step 6: Repurposing Opportunities

**Input**: Approved drugs + new disease associations

**Process**:
- Match drug targets to new disease genes
- Assess mechanistic fit (agonist vs antagonist)
- Check contraindications
- Estimate repurposing probability

**Output**: Repurposing candidates with rationale

**Repurposing Score**:
- Genetic overlap: Gene targeted by drug = gene implicated in new disease
- Clinical feasibility: Dosing, route, safety profile compatible
- Regulatory path: Faster approval (Phase II vs Phase I)

## Use Cases

### Use Case 1: Novel Target Discovery for Rare Disease

**Scenario**: Identify druggable targets for Huntington's disease

**Steps**:
1. Get GWAS hits for Huntington's → HTT, PDE10A, MSH3
2. Assess druggability → PDE10A (phosphodiesterase) = high
3. Find existing PDE10A inhibitors → Multiple tool compounds
4. Recommendation: Develop selective PDE10A inhibitor

**Clinical Context**:
- HTT (huntingtin) = difficult to drug (large, scaffold protein)
- PDE10A = modifier gene, GPCR-coupled, small molecule tractable
- Precedent: PDE5 inhibitors (sildenafil) already approved

### Use Case 2: Drug Repurposing for Common Disease

**Scenario**: Find repurposing opportunities for Alzheimer's disease

**Steps**:
1. Get GWAS targets → APOE, CLU, CR1, PICALM, BIN1, TREM2
2. Find drugs targeting these → Anti-inflammatory drugs (CR1, TREM2)
3. Match approved drugs → Anakinra (IL-1R antagonist)
4. Rationale: TREM2 links inflammation to neurodegeneration

**Example Output**:
```
Repurposing Candidate: Anakinra
- Target: IL-1R → affects TREM2 pathway
- Current use: Rheumatoid arthritis (approved)
- AD rationale: 3 GWAS genes in immune pathway
- Clinical phase: Phase II trial in progress
- Safety: Known profile, subcutaneous injection
```

### Use Case 3: Target Validation for Existing Drug Class

**Scenario**: Validate new diabetes targets related to GLP-1 pathway

**Steps**:
1. Get T2D GWAS genes → TCF7L2, PPARG, KCNJ11, GLP1R
2. GLP1R validated → Existing drug class (semaglutide, liraglutide)
3. Check related genes → GIP, GIPR (glucose-dependent insulinotropic polypeptide)
4. Outcome: Dual GLP-1/GIP agonists (tirzepatide, approved 2022)

## Druggability Assessment Deep Dive

### Target Classes (by Druggability)

**Tier 1: High Druggability**
- **GPCRs** (33% of approved drugs) - Extracellular binding, established chemistry
- **Kinases** (18% of approved drugs) - ATP-competitive inhibitors, allosteric sites
- **Ion channels** (15% of approved drugs) - Blocking/opening channels
- **Nuclear receptors** - Ligand-binding domains

**Tier 2: Moderate Druggability**
- **Proteases** - Active site inhibitors
- **Phosphatases** - Challenging selectivity
- **Epigenetic targets** - Readers, writers, erasers

**Tier 3: Difficult to Drug**

- Examples: Kinase inhibitors, GPCR antagonists

**Antibodies**:
- Target: Extracellular proteins, receptors
- Advantages: High specificity, long half-life
- Disadvantages: Expensive, injection-only, no CNS
- Examples: PD-1 inhibitors, TNF-α blockers

**Antisense/RNAi**:
- Target: mRNA (any gene)
- Advantages: Sequence-specific, undruggable targets
- Disadvantages: Delivery challenges, liver-centric
- Examples: Patisiran (TTR), nusinersen (SMN)

**Gene Therapy**:
- Target: Genetic defects
- Advantages: One-time treatment, curative potential
- Disadvantages: Immunogenicity, manufacturing complexity
- Examples: Luxturna (RPE65), Zolgensma (SMN1)

## Clinical Translation Considerations

### Regulatory Requirements

**IND (Investigational New Drug) Application**:
- Pharmacology and toxicology
- Manufacturing information
- Clinical protocols and investigator information

**Clinical Trial Phases**:
- **Phase I**: Safety, dosing (20-100 healthy volunteers)
- **Phase II**: Efficacy, side effects (100-300 patients)
- **Phase III**: Confirmatory trials (1,000-3,000 patients)
- **Phase IV**: Post-market surveillance

**Repurposing Advantages**:
- Skip Phase I if dosing similar
- Shorter timelines (2-4 years vs 10-15)
- Lower costs ($50M vs $2B)

### Success Rate Benchmarks

**Traditional Drug Development** (Wong et al., Biostatistics 2019):
- Phase I → II: 63%
- Phase II → III: 31%
- Phase III → Approval: 58%
- Overall: 12% (from Phase I to approval)

**With Genetic Evidence** (King et al., PLOS Genetics 2019):
- Phase I → Approval: 24% (2× improvement)
- Phase II → Approval: 38% vs 18% (no genetic support)

### Cost and Timeline

**Traditional Development**:
- Pre-clinical: 3-6 years, $500M
- Clinical trials: 6-7 years, $1-1.5B
- Total: 10-15 years, $2-2.5B

**Repurposing**:
- Pre-clinical: 1-2 years, $50M
- Clinical trials: 2-3 years, $100-200M
- Total: 3-5 years, $150-250M

## Best Practices

### 1. Multi-Ancestry GWAS

**Why**: Genetic architecture varies across populations

**Approach**:
- Include trans-ethnic meta-analyses
- Check replication in multiple ancestries
- Consider population-specific variants

**Example**: APOL1 kidney disease variants (African ancestry-specific)

### 2. Functional Validation

**GWAS alone is not enough** - need mechanistic support:

- **eQTL analysis**: Variant affects gene expression?
- **pQTL analysis**: Variant affects protein levels?
- **Colocalization**: GWAS + eQTL signals overlap?
- **Fine-mapping**: Which variant(s) are causal?

**Tools for validation**:
- GTEx (tissue-specific expression)
- ENCODE (regulatory elements)
- gnomAD (variant frequency, constraint)

### 3. Network and Pathway Analysis

**Beyond Single Genes**:
- Group GWAS hits by pathway (KEGG, Reactome)
- Identify druggable nodes in disease network
- Consider combination therapies

**Example**: Alzheimer's GWAS →
- Immune cluster (TREM2, CR1, CLU)
- Lipid cluster (APOE, ABCA7)
- Endocytosis (BIN1, PICALM)

### 4. Safety Liability Assessment

**Red Flags**:
- Essential gene (loss-of-function lethal)
- Broad expression (on-target toxicity)
- Off-target kinase panel (promiscuity)
- hERG inhibition (cardiotoxicity)
- CYP450 interactions (drug-drug interactions)

**Tools**:
- gnomAD pLI (intolerance to loss-of-function)
- GTEx expression (tissue specificity)
- PharmaGKB (pharmacogenomics)

### 5. Intellectual Property Landscape

**Patent Considerations**:
- Target patents (composition of matter)
- Method of use patents (indication-specific)
- Formulation patents (delivery)

**Freedom to Operate**:
- Existing patents on target
- Blocking patents on drug class
- Expired patents (generic opportunity)

## Limitations and Caveats

### GWAS Limitations

**1. Association ≠ Causation**
- Linkage disequilibrium = true causal variant may differ
- Pleiotropy = gene affects multiple traits
- Confounding = population stratification

**Solution**: Fine-mapping, functional studies, Mendelian randomization

**2. Missing Heritability**
- Common variants explain ~10-50% of heritability
- Rare variants, structural variants, epigenetics matter
- Gene-environment interactions

**Solution**: Whole-genome sequencing, family studies

**3. Druggable ≠ Effective**
- Can bind target ≠ modulates disease
- Right direction (agonist vs antagonist)?
- Right tissue (CNS penetration)?

**Solution**: Experimental validation, disease models

### Target Validation Challenges

**1. Mouse Models ≠ Humans**
- 95% of drugs work in mice, 5% in humans
- Species differences (immune system)
- Acute models ≠ chronic disease

**Solution**: Human cell models (iPSCs, organoids), humanized mice

**2. Genetic Perturbation ≠ Pharmacology**
- Knockout = complete loss, drug = partial inhibition
- Timing matters (developmental vs adult)
- Compensation in knockout

**Solution**: Inducible knockouts, tool compounds

**3. Efficacy ≠ Safety**
- On-target toxicity (essential gene)
- Off-target effects (selectivity)
- Dose-limiting side effects

**Solution**: Therapeutic index assessment, biomarkers

## Ethical and Regulatory Considerations

### Human Genetics Research

**Informed Consent**:
- Secondary use of GWAS data
- Return of results policies
- Privacy protections (de-identification)

**Equity**:
- Most GWAS = European ancestry (78%)
- Risk: Drugs may not work equally across populations
- Solution: Diversify GWAS cohorts

### Clinical Trials

**Study Design**:
- Stratification by genetics (precision medicine)
- Adaptive trials (basket, umbrella designs)
- Real-world evidence (pragmatic trials)

**Patient Selection**:
- Enrichment by genotype (higher response rate)
- Ethics of genetic testing for trial entry
- Cost-effectiveness of stratified medicine

### Regulatory Pathways

**FDA Breakthrough Therapy**:
- Substantial improvement over existing
- Expedited review (6 months vs 10 months)
- Examples: CAR-T therapies, gene therapies

**Accelerated Approval**:
- Based on surrogate endpoints
- Post-market confirmation required
- Risk: Approval withdrawal if confirmatory fails
