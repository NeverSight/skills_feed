Design novel protein therapeutics (binders, enzymes, scaffolds) using AI-guided de novo design. Uses RFdiffusion for backbone generation, ProteinMPNN for sequence design, ESMFold/AlphaFold2 for validation. Use when asked to design protein binders, therapeutic proteins, or engineer protein function.
