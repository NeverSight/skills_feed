Computational analysis framework for spatial multi-omics data integration. Given spatially variable genes (SVGs), spatial domain annotations, tissue type, and disease context from spatial transcriptomics/proteomics experiments (10x Visium, MERFISH, DBiTplus, SLIDE-seq, etc.), performs comprehensive biological interpretation including pathway enrichment, cell-cell interaction inference, druggable target identification, immune microenvironment characterization, and multi-modal integration. Produces a detailed markdown report with Spatial Omics Integration Score (0-100), domain-by-domain characterization, and validation recommendations. Uses 70+ ToolUniverse tools across 9 analysis phases. Use when users ask about spatial transcriptomics analysis, spatial omics interpretation, tissue heterogeneity, spatial gene expression patterns, tumor microenvironment mapping, tissue zonation, or cell-cell communication from spatial data.
