Comprehensive metabolomics research skill for identifying metabolites, analyzing studies, and searching metabolomics databases. Integrates HMDB (220k+ metabolites), MetaboLights, Metabolomics Workbench, and PubChem. Use when asked to identify or annotate metabolites (HMDB IDs, chemical properties, pathways), retrieve metabolomics study information from MetaboLights (MTBLS*) or Metabolomics Workbench (ST*), search for studies by keywords or disease, or generate comprehensive metabolomics research reports.
