Comprehensive epigenomics and gene regulation analysis integrating ENCODE functional genomics data, JASPAR transcription factor binding motifs, SCREEN cis-regulatory elements, ReMap TF binding sites, RegulomeDB variant regulatory scoring, 4D Nucleome chromatin conformation, and Ensembl regulatory features. Performs regulatory element cataloging, transcription factor analysis, variant regulatory impact scoring, chromatin conformation mapping, and gene-centric regulatory landscape profiling. Use when asked about gene regulation, enhancers, promoters, transcription factor binding, epigenetic modifications, chromatin structure, regulatory variants, or non-coding genome function.
