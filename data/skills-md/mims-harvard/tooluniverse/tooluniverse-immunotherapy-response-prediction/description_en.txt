Predict patient response to immune checkpoint inhibitors (ICIs) using multi-biomarker integration. Given a cancer type, somatic mutations, and optional biomarkers (TMB, PD-L1, MSI status), performs systematic analysis across 11 phases covering TMB classification, neoantigen burden estimation, MSI/MMR assessment, PD-L1 evaluation, immune microenvironment profiling, mutation-based resistance/sensitivity prediction, clinical evidence retrieval, and multi-biomarker score integration. Generates a quantitative ICI Response Score (0-100), response likelihood tier, specific ICI drug recommendations with evidence, resistance risk factors, and a monitoring plan. Use when oncologists ask about immunotherapy eligibility, checkpoint inhibitor selection, or biomarker-guided ICI treatment decisions.
