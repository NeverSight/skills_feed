# Network Pharmacology Pipeline

Construct and analyze compound-target-disease (C-T-D) networks to identify drug repurposing opportunities, understand polypharmacology, and predict drug mechanisms using systems pharmacology approaches.

**IMPORTANT**: Always use English terms in tool calls (drug names, disease names, target names), even if the user writes in another language. Only try original-language terms as a fallback if English returns no results. Respond in the user's language.

---

## When to Use This Skill

Apply when users:
- Ask "Can [drug] be repurposed for [disease] based on network analysis?"
- Want to understand multi-target (polypharmacology) effects of a compound
- Need compound-target-disease network construction and analysis
- Ask about network proximity between drug targets and disease genes
- Want systems pharmacology analysis of a drug or target
- Ask about drug repurposing candidates ranked by network metrics
- Need mechanism prediction for a drug in a new indication
- Want to identify hub genes in disease networks as therapeutic targets
- Ask about disease module coverage by a compound's targets

**NOT for** (use other skills instead):
- Simple drug repurposing without network analysis -> Use `tooluniverse-drug-repurposing`
- Single target validation -> Use `tooluniverse-drug-target-validation`
- Adverse event detection only -> Use `tooluniverse-adverse-event-detection`
- General disease research -> Use `tooluniverse-disease-research`
- GWAS interpretation -> Use `tooluniverse-gwas-snp-interpretation`

- Moderate proximity (Z < -1, p < 0.05): 20 points
- Weak proximity (Z < -0.5): 10 points
- No proximity: 0 points

**Clinical Evidence** (0-25 points):
- Approved for related indication: 25 points
- Active clinical trials: 15 points
- Completed trials with positive results: 10 points
- Preclinical only: 5 points

**Target-Disease Association** (0-20 points):

## KEY PRINCIPLES

1. **Report-first approach** - Create report file FIRST, then populate progressively
2. **Entity disambiguation FIRST** - Resolve all identifiers before analysis
3. **Bidirectional network** - Construct C-T-D network comprehensively from both directions
4. **Network metrics** - Calculate proximity, centrality, module overlap quantitatively
5. **Rank candidates** - Prioritize by composite Network Pharmacology Score
6. **Mechanism prediction** - Explain HOW drug could work for disease via network paths
7. **Clinical feasibility** - FDA-approved drugs ranked higher than preclinical
8. **Safety context** - Flag known adverse events and off-target liabilities
9. **Evidence grading** - Grade all evidence T1-T4
10. **Negative results documented** - "No data" is data; empty sections are failures
11. **Source references** - Every finding must cite the source tool/database
12. **Completeness checklist** - Mandatory section at end showing analysis coverage

)

# Get BindingDB ligands for key targets (if UniProt ID available)
# binding_data = tu.tools.BindingDB_get_ligands_by_uniprot(uniprot_accession="P49768")
```

**Step 2.2**: Target-disease edges (genetic and functional associations).

```python

for target in top_disease_targets[:10]:
    td_evidence = tu.tools.OpenTargets_target_disease_evidence(
        efoId=disease_id,

)

# Get PharmGKB gene details (pharmacogenomics)

```

**Step 2.3**: Compound-disease edges (clinical evidence).

```python
# Get clinical trial evidence
trials = tu.tools.search_clinical_trials(
    query_term="metformin",
    condition="Alzheimer",
    pageSize=20

    max_node=50,
    interaction="sn",
    string_mode="physical"
)
```

---

### Phase 3: Network Analysis

**Step 3.1**: Network topology analysis (computed from collected data).

```
Compute from Phase 2 data:

1. Node Degree:
   - Count connections per node from STRING + IntAct + OpenTargets interactions
   - Drug targets: connections from bioactivity data
   - Disease genes: connections from PPI data

2. Hub Identification:
   - Nodes with degree > mean + 2*SD are hubs
   - Hub genes in disease module = priority therapeutic targets

3. Betweenness Centrality:
   - Nodes on shortest paths between drug targets and disease genes
   - High betweenness = potential mediating/bridging targets

4. Network Modules:
   - Disease module: cluster of disease-associated genes in PPI
   - Drug module: cluster of drug target genes in PPI
   - Module overlap = direct network relevance

5. Shortest Paths:
   - Paths from each drug target to each disease gene via PPI
   - Shortest path length < 2 = direct interaction
   - Path length 2-3 = close proximity
   - Path length > 4 = distant, weaker association
```

**Step 3.2**: Network proximity calculation.

```
Network Proximity Z-score (computed from data):

1. Collect drug target set T_d from Phase 1
2. Collect disease gene set G_d from Phase 1
3. For each drug target t in T_d and disease gene g in G_d:
   - Find shortest path d(t,g) in PPI network from Phase 2
4. Compute closest proximity: d_c = mean of min distances
5. Compare against random expectation:
   - Sample N random gene sets of same size as T_d
   - Compute proximity for each random set
   - Z = (d_c - mean_random) / sd_random
6. Z < -2: strong proximity (35 points)
   Z < -1: moderate proximity (20 points)
   Z < -0.5: weak proximity (10 points)
   Z >= -0.5: no proximity (0 points)

Practical computation from STRING/OpenTargets PPI data:
- Count direct interactions between drug targets and disease genes
- Count shared PPI partners (second-degree connections)
- Calculate overlap coefficient = shared_partners / min(degree_t, degree_d)
- Use number of shared pathways as additional proximity metric
```

**Step 3.3**: Functional enrichment analysis.

```python
# STRING functional enrichment for disease genes
disease_gene_symbols = [t['target']['approvedSymbol']
                        for t in disease_targets['data']['disease']['associatedTargets']['rows'][:20]]

string_enrichment = tu.tools.STRING_functional_enrichment(
    protein_ids=disease_gene_symbols,
    species=9606
)

# STRING PPI enrichment (statistical test for network connectivity)
string_ppi_enrich = tu.tools.STRING_ppi_enrichment(
    protein_ids=disease_gene_symbols,
    species=9606
)

# Enrichr pathway analysis
enrichr_results = tu.tools.enrichr_gene_enrichment_analysis(
    gene_list=disease_gene_symbols,
    libs=["KEGG_2021_Human", "Reactome_2022", "GO_Biological_Process_2023"]
)
# Returns enrichment results per library

# Reactome pathway enrichment
reactome_enrichment = tu.tools.ReactomeAnalysis_pathway_enrichment(
    identifiers=" ".join(disease_gene_symbols)
)
# Returns: {data: {pathways: [{pathway_id, name, p_value, fdr, entities_found, ...}]}}
```

### Phase 4: Drug Repurposing Predictions

**Step 4.1**: Identify and rank repurposing candidates.

```python
# For disease-to-compound mode: Find drugs targeting disease genes
repurposing_candidates = []

for target in disease_targets['data']['disease']['associatedTargets']['rows'][:20]:
    gene_symbol = target['target']['approvedSymbol']
    ensembl_id = target['target']['id']
    target_score = target['score']

    # Get drugs from OpenTargets
    target_drugs = tu.tools.OpenTargets_get_associated_drugs_by_target_ensemblID(
        ensemblId=ensembl_id, size=20
    )

    # Get drugs from DGIdb
    dgidb_drugs = tu.tools.DGIdb_get_drug_gene_interactions(genes=[gene_symbol])

    # Get drugs from DrugBank

        query=gene_symbol, case_sensitive=False, exact_match=False, limit=20
    )

    # Collect and deduplicate candidates
    # Score each by: target_disease_score * drug_target_affinity * approval_status

# For compound-to-disease mode: Already have drug targets, find their diseases
for target in drug_targets:
    # Get diseases associated with each drug target
    target_diseases = tu.tools.OpenTargets_get_diseases_phenotypes_by_target_ensembl(
        ensemblId=target['id'], size=20
    )
```

**Step 4.2**: Mechanism prediction for repurposing candidates.

```python
# For each repurposing candidate, trace the network path:
# Drug -> Direct targets -> PPI neighbors -> Disease genes

# Get drug mechanism
drug_moa = tu.tools.OpenTargets_get_drug_mechanisms_of_action_by_chemblId(
    chemblId=candidate_chembl_id
)

# Get pathways shared between drug targets and disease genes
drug_target_genes = [t['approvedSymbol'] for t in drug_moa_targets]
combined_genes = list(set(drug_target_genes + disease_gene_symbols[:10]))

# Pathway enrichment for combined gene set
combined_pathways = tu.tools.ReactomeAnalysis_pathway_enrichment(
    identifiers=" ".join(combined_genes)
)

# Check for specific pathway overlap
drug_pathways = tu.tools.drugbank_get_pathways_reactions_by_drug_or_id(
    query=drug_name, case_sensitive=False, exact_match=True, limit=1
)
```

# From OpenTargets
all_drug_targets = tu.tools.OpenTargets_get_associated_targets_by_drug_chemblId(
    chemblId=chembl_id, size=100

    query=drug_name, case_sensitive=False, exact_match=True, limit=1
)

# From CTD (chemical-gene interactions, includes indirect)
ctd_interactions = tu.tools.CTD_get_chemical_gene_interactions(
    input_terms=drug_name
)

# Classify targets: primary (mechanism) vs secondary (off-target)
# Count disease module coverage
drug_target_set = set(drug_target_genes)
disease_gene_set = set(disease_gene_symbols[:50])
overlap = drug_target_set & disease_gene_set
coverage = len(overlap) / len(disease_gene_set) if disease_gene_set else 0

# Target family analysis
for gene in drug_target_genes[:10]:
    target_class = tu.tools.OpenTargets_get_target_classes_by_ensemblID(
        ensemblId=gene_ensembl_id
    )
```

**Step 5.2**: Selectivity analysis.

```python
# Get target druggability and development levels
for gene in drug_target_genes[:10]:
    # DGIdb druggability
    druggability = tu.tools.DGIdb_get_gene_druggability(genes=[gene])

    # Pharos target development level
    pharos_info = tu.tools.Pharos_get_target(target_name=gene)
    # Tclin = known drug targets, Tchem = has chemical tools, Tbio = has biology, Tdark = dark target

    # OpenTargets tractability
    tractability = tu.tools.OpenTargets_get_target_tractability_by_ensemblID(
        ensemblId=gene_ensembl_id
    )
```

2. Clinical Evidence Score (0-25):
   - Search clinical trials for drug-disease pair
   - Check approved indications for related diseases
   - Check max clinical trial phase

3. Target-Disease Association Score (0-20):
   - Average OpenTargets association score for drug targets in disease
   - Weight by evidence type (genetic > functional > computational)

4. Safety Score (0-10):
   - FDA approval status (+5)
   - Black box warning (-3)
   - Death reports proportion
   - Off-target count penalty

5. Mechanism Plausibility Score (0-10):
   - Known mechanism for related indication (+5)
   - Pathway evidence (+3)
   - Network path length to disease module (+2)

Total: sum of components (0-100)

## Common Use Patterns

### Pattern 1: Drug Repurposing via Network Proximity
```
Input: compound (metformin) + disease (Alzheimer disease)
Mode: compound-to-disease

Flow:
1. Resolve metformin -> CHEMBL1431, DB00331, CID:4091
2. Get metformin targets (OpenTargets, DrugBank, DGIdb)
3. Get Alzheimer disease genes (OpenTargets, GWAS)
4. Build PPI network (STRING, OpenTargets interactions)
5. Calculate proximity between drug targets and disease genes
6. Score and rank by Network Pharmacology Score
7. Predict mechanism via shared pathways
8. Validate with clinical trials and literature
```

### Pattern 2: Disease-Driven Drug Discovery
```
Input: disease (lupus)
Mode: disease-to-compound

Flow:
1. Resolve lupus -> MONDO/EFO ID
2. Get disease-associated targets (top 50)
3. For each target, find approved drugs (OpenTargets, DGIdb, DrugBank)
4. Build C-T-D network from all drug-target-disease edges
5. Rank drugs by: number of disease targets hit, network proximity, safety
6. Identify polypharmacology advantages (drugs hitting multiple disease targets)
```

### Pattern 3: Target-Centric Network
```
Input: target (EGFR)
Mode: target-centric

Flow:
1. Resolve EGFR -> ENSG00000146648
2. Get all compounds targeting EGFR (with bioactivity)
3. Get all diseases associated with EGFR
4. Build PPI network around EGFR
5. Identify which compounds could bridge to which diseases
6. Rank compound-disease pairs by network metrics
```

### Pattern 4: Polypharmacology Profiling
```
Input: compound (aspirin)
Mode: bidirectional

Flow:
1. Resolve aspirin -> CHEMBL25
2. Get ALL targets (not just primary)
3. Map targets to disease modules
4. Identify multi-target coverage across diseases
5. Analyze synergistic vs antagonistic effects
6. Compare selectivity across target families
```

### Pattern 5: Mechanism Elucidation
```
Input: compound (rapamycin) + disease (aging/longevity)
Mode: compound-to-disease

Flow:
1. Resolve rapamycin -> CHEMBL413 (sirolimus)
2. Get mechanism: mTOR inhibitor
3. Map mTOR pathway to aging-related genes
4. Trace network paths: rapamycin -> mTOR -> autophagy -> aging genes
5. Assess pathway overlap and functional enrichment
6. Provide mechanistic explanation
```

## Edge Cases

### Promiscuous Compounds (many targets)
- Limit initial target retrieval to top 50 by confidence
- Classify into primary (mechanism) vs secondary (off-target)
- Focus network analysis on primary targets first
- Note polypharmacology implications

### Orphan Diseases (limited data)
- Expand to parent disease categories in ontology
- Use related diseases from OpenTargets similar entities
- Leverage pathway-level analysis over gene-level
- Note data limitations in report

### Novel Targets (no known drugs)
- Focus on target biology and disease association
- Use DGIdb druggability assessment
- Search for chemical probes (OpenTargets chemical probes)
- Suggest target-based screening approaches

### Large Networks (>100 nodes)
- Prioritize top-scored edges
- Use network modules rather than full network
- Focus on shortest paths between entities
- Summarize statistics rather than listing all nodes

### Disconnected Networks
- Report disconnection explicitly
- Analyze drug module and disease module separately
- Look for pathway-level connections as bridge
- Note that disconnection suggests low repurposing potential

---

## Troubleshooting

**"Disease not found"**:
- Try disease synonyms (e.g., "Alzheimer's disease" vs "Alzheimer disease")
- Use EFO/MONDO ID directly if known
- Search with `OpenTargets_multi_entity_search_by_query_string(queryString=...)` for broader matching
- Try parent disease category

**"No drugs found for target"**:
- Target may be Tdark (no chemical tools) - check with Pharos
- Expand to target family or pathway
- Search DGIdb which aggregates multiple sources
- Check chemical probes as starting points

**"No PPI data"**:
- Try different protein identifiers (gene symbol, UniProt, Ensembl protein)
- Use multiple PPI databases (STRING + IntAct + OpenTargets)
- Lower confidence threshold in STRING
- Use pathway co-membership as proxy for interaction

**"Network proximity not significant"**:
- Drug targets may be functionally distant from disease module
- Try expanding disease gene set (increase limit)
- Consider indirect mechanisms via shared pathways
- Report honestly - not all drug-disease pairs have network support

**"DrugBank parameter errors"**:
- ALL DrugBank tools require 4 params: `query`, `case_sensitive`, `exact_match`, `limit`
- Use `case_sensitive=False`, `exact_match=True` for exact drug name matching
- Use `exact_match=False` for broader searches

**"FAERS operation errors"**:
- Analytics tools (disproportionality, compare, filter, stratify) need `operation` param
- Count tools use `medicinalproduct` NOT `drug_name`
- Check FAERS tool name carefully to determine which pattern
