Construct and analyze compound-target-disease networks for drug repurposing, polypharmacology discovery, and systems pharmacology. Builds multi-layer networks from ChEMBL, OpenTargets, STRING, DrugBank, Reactome, FAERS, and 60+ other ToolUniverse tools. Calculates Network Pharmacology Scores (0-100), identifies repurposing candidates, predicts mechanisms, and analyzes polypharmacology. Use when users ask about drug repurposing via network analysis, multi-target drug effects, compound-target-disease networks, systems pharmacology, or polypharmacology.
