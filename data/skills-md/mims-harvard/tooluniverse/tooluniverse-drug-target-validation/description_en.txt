Comprehensive computational validation of drug targets for early-stage drug discovery. Evaluates targets across 10 dimensions (disambiguation, disease association, druggability, chemical matter, clinical precedent, safety, pathway context, validation evidence, structural insights, validation roadmap) using 60+ ToolUniverse tools. Produces a quantitative Target Validation Score (0-100) with GO/NO-GO recommendation. Use when users ask about target validation, druggability assessment, target prioritization, or "is X a good drug target for Y?"
