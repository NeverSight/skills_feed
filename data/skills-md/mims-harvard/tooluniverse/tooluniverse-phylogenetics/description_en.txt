Production-ready phylogenetics and sequence analysis skill for alignment processing, tree analysis, and evolutionary metrics. Computes treeness, RCV, treeness/RCV, parsimony informative sites, evolutionary rate, DVMC, tree length, alignment gap statistics, GC content, and bootstrap support using PhyKIT, Biopython, and DendroPy. Performs NJ/UPGMA/parsimony tree construction, Robinson-Foulds distance, Mann-Whitney U tests, and batch analysis across gene families. Integrates with ToolUniverse for sequence retrieval (NCBI, UniProt, Ensembl) and tree annotation. Use when processing FASTA/PHYLIP/Nexus/Newick files, computing phylogenetic metrics, comparing taxa groups, or answering questions about alignments, trees, parsimony, or molecular evolution.
