# Phylogenetics and Sequence Analysis

Comprehensive phylogenetics and sequence analysis using PhyKIT, Biopython, and DendroPy. Designed for bioinformatics questions about multiple sequence alignments, phylogenetic trees, parsimony, molecular evolution, and comparative genomics.

**IMPORTANT**: This skill handles complex phylogenetic workflows. Most implementation details have been moved to `references/` for progressive disclosure. This document focuses on high-level decision-making and workflow orchestration.

---

## When to Use This Skill

Apply when users:
- Have FASTA alignment files and ask about parsimony informative sites, gaps, or alignment quality
- Have Newick tree files and ask about treeness, tree length, evolutionary rate, or DVMC
- Ask about treeness/RCV, RCV, or relative composition variability
- Need to compare phylogenetic metrics between groups (fungi vs animals, etc.)
- Ask about PhyKIT functions (treeness, rcv, dvmc, evo_rate, parsimony_informative, tree_length)
- Have gene family data with paired alignments and trees
- Need Mann-Whitney U tests or other statistical comparisons of phylogenetic metrics
- Ask about bootstrap support, branch lengths, or tree topology
- Need to build trees (NJ, UPGMA, parsimony) from alignments
- Ask about Robinson-Foulds distance or tree comparison

**BixBench Coverage**: 33 questions across 8 projects (bix-4, bix-11, bix-12, bix-25, bix-35, bix-38, bix-45, bix-60)

**NOT for** (use other skills instead):
- Multiple sequence alignment generation → Use external tools (MUSCLE, MAFFT, ClustalW)
- Maximum Likelihood tree construction → Use IQ-TREE, RAxML, or PhyML
- Bayesian phylogenetics → Use MrBayes or BEAST
- Ancestral state reconstruction → Use separate tools

---

## Core Principles

1. **Data-first approach** - Discover and validate all input files (alignments, trees) before any analysis
2. **PhyKIT-compatible** - Use PhyKIT functions for treeness, RCV, DVMC, parsimony, evolutionary rate (matches BixBench expected outputs)
3. **Format-flexible** - Support FASTA, PHYLIP, Nexus, Newick, and auto-detect formats
4. **Batch processing** - Process hundreds of gene alignments/trees in a single analysis
5. **Statistical rigor** - Mann-Whitney U, medians, percentiles, standard deviations with scipy.stats
6. **Precision awareness** - Match rounding to 4 decimal places (PhyKIT default) or as requested
7. **Group comparison** - Compare metrics between taxa groups (e.g., fungi vs animals)
8. **Question-driven** - Parse exactly what is asked and return the specific number/statistic

## Common Analysis Patterns (BixBench)

### Pattern 1: Single Metric Across Groups

**Question**: "What is the median DVMC for fungi vs animals?"

**Workflow**:
```python
# 1. Discover files
fungi_genes = discover_gene_files("data/fungi")
animal_genes = discover_gene_files("data/animals")

# 2. Compute metric
fungi_dvmc = batch_dvmc(fungi_genes)
animal_dvmc = batch_dvmc(animal_genes)

# 3. Compare
fungi_values = list(fungi_dvmc.values())
animal_values = list(animal_dvmc.values())

print(f"Fungi median DVMC: {np.median(fungi_values):.4f}")
print(f"Animal median DVMC: {np.median(animal_values):.4f}")
```

**See**: `references/parsimony_analysis.md` for full implementation

### Pattern 2: Statistical Comparison

**Question**: "What is the Mann-Whitney U statistic comparing treeness between groups?"

**Workflow**:
```python
from scipy import stats

# Compute treeness for both groups
group1_treeness = batch_treeness(group1_genes)
group2_treeness = batch_treeness(group2_genes)

# Mann-Whitney U test (two-sided)
u_stat, p_value = stats.mannwhitneyu(
    list(group1_treeness.values()),
    list(group2_treeness.values()),
    alternative='two-sided'
)

print(f"U statistic: {u_stat:.0f}")
print(f"P-value: {p_value:.4e}")
```

### Pattern 3: Filtering + Metric

**Question**: "What is the treeness/RCV for alignments with <5% gaps?"

**Workflow**:
```python
# 1. Filter by gap percentage
valid_genes = []
for entry in gene_files:
    if 'aln_file' in entry:
        gap_pct = alignment_gap_percentage(entry['aln_file'])
        if gap_pct < 5.0:
            valid_genes.append(entry)

# 2. Compute metric on filtered set
results = batch_treeness_over_rcv(valid_genes)

# 3. Report
values = [r[0] for r in results.values()]  # treeness/rcv ratio
print(f"Median treeness/RCV: {np.median(values):.4f}")
```

### Pattern 4: Specific Gene Lookup

**Question**: "What is the evolutionary rate for gene X?"

**Workflow**:
```python
# Find gene file
gene_files = discover_gene_files("data/")
gene_entry = [g for g in gene_files if g['gene_id'] == 'X'][0]

# Compute metric
evo_rate = phykit_evolutionary_rate(gene_entry['tree_file'])

print(f"Evolutionary rate for gene X: {evo_rate:.4f}")
```

## Choosing Methods: When to Use What

### Alignment Methods

**When building alignments** (use external tools, not this skill):

| Method | Speed | Accuracy | Use Case |
|--------|-------|----------|----------|
| **ClustalW** | Slow | Medium | Small datasets (<100 sequences), educational |
| **MUSCLE** | Fast | High | Medium datasets (100-1000 sequences) |
| **MAFFT** | Very Fast | Very High | **Recommended** - Large datasets (>1000 sequences) |

**For this skill**: Work with pre-aligned sequences. Use `load_alignment()` to read any format.

### Tree Building Methods

**When to use which tree method:**

| Method | Speed | Accuracy | Use Case |
|--------|-------|----------|----------|
| **Neighbor-Joining** | Fast | Medium | Quick trees, large datasets, exploratory |
| **UPGMA** | Fast | Low | Assumes molecular clock, special cases only |
| **Maximum Parsimony** | Medium | Medium | Small datasets, discrete characters |
| **Maximum Likelihood** | Slow | High | **Use external tools** (IQ-TREE, RAxML) for production |

**Implementation in this skill**:
```python
# Fast distance-based trees
tree = build_nj_tree("alignment.fa")  # Neighbor-Joining
tree = build_upgma_tree("alignment.fa")  # UPGMA

# Parsimony (for small alignments)
tree = build_parsimony_tree("alignment.fa")
```

**For production ML trees**: Use IQ-TREE or RAxML externally, then analyze with this skill.

See `references/tree_building.md` for detailed implementations.

## Batch Processing

### Discovering Gene Files

```python
# Auto-discover paired alignment + tree files
gene_files = discover_gene_files("data/")

# Result: list of dicts with 'gene_id', 'aln_file', 'tree_file'
# [
#   {'gene_id': 'gene1', 'aln_file': 'gene1.fa', 'tree_file': 'gene1.nwk'},
#   {'gene_id': 'gene2', 'aln_file': 'gene2.fa', 'tree_file': 'gene2.nwk'},
#   ...
# ]
```

### Computing Metrics in Batch

```python
# Tree metrics
treeness_results = batch_treeness(gene_files)
tree_length_results = batch_tree_length(gene_files)
dvmc_results = batch_dvmc(gene_files)
evo_rate_results = batch_evolutionary_rate(gene_files)

# Alignment metrics
rcv_results = batch_rcv(gene_files)
pi_results = batch_parsimony_informative(gene_files)
gap_results = batch_gap_percentage(gene_files)

# Combined metrics
treeness_rcv_results = batch_treeness_over_rcv(gene_files)

# All return dict: {gene_id: value}
```

### Statistical Analysis

```python
# Summary statistics
stats = summary_stats(list(treeness_results.values()))
# Returns: {'mean': ..., 'median': ..., 'std': ..., 'min': ..., 'max': ...}

# Group comparison
comparison = compare_groups(
    list(fungi_treeness.values()),
    list(animal_treeness.values()),
    group1_name="Fungi",
    group2_name="Animals"
)
# Returns: {'u_statistic': ..., 'p_value': ..., 'Fungi': {...}, 'Animals': {...}}
```

See `references/parsimony_analysis.md` for full workflow.

## Answer Extraction for BixBench

| Question Pattern | Extraction Method |
|-----------------|-------------------|
| "What is the median X?" | `np.median(values)` |
| "What is the maximum X?" | `np.max(values)` |
| "What is the difference between median X for A vs B?" | `abs(np.median(a) - np.median(b))` |
| "What percentage of X have Y above Z?" | `sum(v > Z for v in values) / len(values) * 100` |
| "What is the Mann-Whitney U statistic?" | `stats.mannwhitneyu(a, b)[0]` |
| "What is the p-value?" | `stats.mannwhitneyu(a, b)[1]` |
| "What is the X value for gene Y?" | `results[gene_id]` |
| "What is the fold-change in median X?" | `np.median(a) / np.median(b)` |
| "multiplied by 1000" | `round(value * 1000)` |

### Rounding Rules

- **PhyKIT default**: 4 decimal places
- **Percentages**: Match question format (e.g., "35%" → integer, "3.5%" → 1 decimal)
- **P-values**: Scientific notation for very small values
- **U statistics**: Integer (no decimals)
- **Always check question wording**: "rounded to 3 decimal places" overrides defaults
