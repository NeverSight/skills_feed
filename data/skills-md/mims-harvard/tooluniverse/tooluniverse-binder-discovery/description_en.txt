Discover novel small molecule binders for protein targets using structure-based and ligand-based approaches. Creates actionable reports with candidate compounds, ADMET profiles, and synthesis feasibility. Use when users ask to find small molecules for a target, identify novel binders, perform virtual screening, or need hit-to-lead compound identification.
