Systematic clinical variant interpretation from raw variant calls to ACMG-classified recommendations with structural impact analysis. Aggregates evidence from ClinVar, gnomAD, CIViC, UniProt, and PDB across ACMG criteria. Produces pathogenicity scores (0-100), clinical recommendations, and treatment implications. Use when interpreting genetic variants, classifying variants of uncertain significance (VUS), performing ACMG variant classification, or translating variant calls to clinical actionability.
