Ensures WordPress.org compliance for freemium plugins (free vs premium features, license keys, trial limits, upselling). Prevents trialware violations. Use when adding premium features, implementing upsells, checking license keys, creating teasers, reviewing code before WordPress.org submission, or when the user mentions "premium", "upsell", or "freemium".
