Capture project decisions into a per-file system in a decisions/ directory. Each decision is a markdown file with YAML frontmatter (queryable metadata) and full context (rationale, options, conversation highlights, artifacts). An auto-generated _index.md provides fast scanning. Use when: (1) User invokes /DL or /DecisionLog, (2) User says 'log this decision', 'capture this decision', 'record decision', 'update the decision log', (3) User asks 'what decisions have we made', or (4) User asks for context on a past decision.
