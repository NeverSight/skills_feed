Use this skill when the user wants to call different LLM models through OpenRouter's unified API, compare model responses, track costs and response times, or find the best model for a task. Triggers include requests to test models, benchmark performance, use specific providers (OpenAI, Anthropic, Google, etc.), or optimize for speed/cost.
