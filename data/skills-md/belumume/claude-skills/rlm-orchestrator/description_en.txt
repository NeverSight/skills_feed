Implement RLM-style (Recursive Language Model) orchestration for complex tasks. This skill should be used when facing large context requirements, multi-part tasks that would benefit from parallel execution, or when context rot is a concern. Automatically decomposes tasks, spawns parallel subagents, aggregates results, and iterates until completion. Inspired by the RLM research paper (arXiv:2512.24601).
