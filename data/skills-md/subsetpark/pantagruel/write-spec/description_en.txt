Co-author a Pantagruel (.pant) specification through guided conversation. Use when the user wants to write, design, or iterate on a Pantagruel spec file. Helps users think rigorously about domains, rules, invariants, actions, and initial state by asking clarifying questions rather than guessing. Trigger when user mentions writing a spec, modeling a system, or working with .pant files.
