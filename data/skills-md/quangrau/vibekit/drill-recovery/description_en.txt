Disaster recovery drill exercises and security checklists for web application projects (SPA, SSR, full-stack web apps). Focused on solo/indie developers using free-tier infrastructure (Vercel, Supabase, Cloudflare, Netlify, Railway, etc.). Bridges big-tech best practices (NIST, Google SRE DiRT, ISO 22301) to indie scale. Use when the user mentions drills, disaster recovery, security audit, incident simulation, project health check, resilience testing, backup strategies, secret rotation, or incident response for web projects. Not for mobile apps, desktop software, CLI tools, or games.
