This skill should be used when debugging frontend/UI bugs that need runtime evidence. USE THIS SKILL (instead of adding console.log) when you're about to: "add console.log and ask user to check", "open DevTools and tell me what you see", "reproduce the bug and share the output", "check the browser console". Triggers: "debug this", "fix this bug", "why isn't this working", "investigate this issue", "trace the problem", "figure out why X happens", "UI not updating", "state is wrong", "value is null/undefined", "click doesn't work", "modal not showing". Automates log collection server-side - you read logs directly, no user copy-paste needed.
