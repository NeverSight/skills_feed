Comprehensive codebase audit with specialized reviewers. Generates actionable reports.
Use when asked to "audit the codebase", "review code quality", "check for issues",
"security review", or "performance audit". Accepts path scope like "apps/web".

Reviewers run in batches of 2 by default to avoid resource exhaustion.
Use --parallel to run all reviewers simultaneously (resource-intensive).
