Audit and fix responsive/mobile issues across every page of a project, using Chrome MCP
screenshots at two breakpoints (375px mobile, 1440px desktop). Design-aware: reads existing
design docs to preserve aesthetic intent, not just "make it fit."
Use when asked to "make it responsive", "fix mobile", "responsive audit", or after building
a desktop-first UI that needs mobile adaptation.
