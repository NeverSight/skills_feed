Use the ntion CLI to interact with Notion workspaces — searching, reading, creating, updating, and managing pages, databases (data sources), and block content. Use when the user wants to: (1) search their Notion workspace, (2) query or list databases, (3) read, create, update, archive, or relate pages, (4) read, append, insert, replace, or delete block content on pages, (5) manage Notion authentication, or (6) perform any Notion workspace operation from the terminal. Trigger on mentions of "Notion", "ntion", page/database IDs, or requests involving workspace content management.
