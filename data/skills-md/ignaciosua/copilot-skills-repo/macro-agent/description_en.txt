Desktop macro control with image recognition. Commands: find, search, click-on, click, move-to, write, press, hotkey, scroll, drag, screenshot, region-capture, seq-create/add/run/list/delete. ALWAYS uses template matching (image search), NEVER fixed coordinates. Use 'region-capture' to capture new elements.
