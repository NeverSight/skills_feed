Manage documentation in the docs/ git submodule with proper structure and synchronization. Use when (1) user explicitly mentions "add docs", "specs", or documentation creation, (2) creating or reading files in docs/ directory, (3) working on features that need specification documents, implementation plans, or progress tracking, (4) documenting solutions, PRDs, or technical specs. Handles submodule initialization, proper directory structure (solutions/specs/feature), syncing from remote master, and committing changes.
