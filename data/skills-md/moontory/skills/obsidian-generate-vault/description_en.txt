Generate a complete Obsidian vault structured as a second brain for software engineers. Use when the user asks to create, scaffold, or set up an Obsidian vault, note-taking system, second brain, or personal knowledge management (PKM) workspace. Copies a pre-built vault with numbered folders, templates (Templater syntax), and convention docs — ready to open in Obsidian.
