Deploy, configure, and integrate Sandbox Agent - a universal API for orchestrating AI coding agents (Claude Code, Codex, OpenCode, Amp) in sandboxed environments. Use when setting up sandbox-agent server locally or in cloud sandboxes (E2B, Daytona, Docker), creating and managing agent sessions via SDK or API, streaming agent events and handling human-in-the-loop interactions, building chat UIs for coding agents, or understanding the universal schema for agent responses.
