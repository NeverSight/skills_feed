Complete PostHog lifecycle management. Audits current state, fixes all issues,
and verifies event tracking works end-to-end. Every run does all of this.

Auto-invoke when: files contain posthog/analytics/tracking, imports posthog-js
package, references POSTHOG_* env vars, event tracking code modified, user
mentions "analytics not working" or "events not sending".
