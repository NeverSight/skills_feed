Investigate local development issues: test failures, runtime errors, type errors,
unexpected behavior. Use when something doesn't work locally, tests fail, builds break,
or behavior differs from expectation. Distinct from /investigate (production) and
/fix-ci (CI pipeline). Keywords: debug, why doesn't, broken, failing, error, crash,
undefined, unexpected, doesn't work, local testing.
