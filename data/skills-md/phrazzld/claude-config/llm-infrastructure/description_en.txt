Comprehensive LLM audit. Model currency, prompt quality, evals, observability, CI/CD.
Ensures all LLM-powered features follow best practices and are properly instrumented.

Auto-invoke when: model names/versions mentioned, AI provider config, prompt changes,
.env with AI keys, aiProviders.ts or prompts.ts modified, AI-related PRs.

CRITICAL: Training data lags months. ALWAYS web search before LLM decisions.
