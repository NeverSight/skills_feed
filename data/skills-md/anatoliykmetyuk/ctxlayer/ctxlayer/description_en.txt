Manages context layer domains, tasks, and documentation. Use when the user mentions "context layer" (e.g. "using context layer", "in the context layer", "in the context", "to the context layer", "into the context layer") ctx commands, context layer projects or tasks, or requests you to write any form of documentation -- such as documenting implemented features, research findings, or drawing diagrams. Also use when the user asks to add a repository to the context layer, clone a repo as context layer context, or access context layer's "data" folder.
