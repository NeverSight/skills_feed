Use this when you need to EVALUATE OR IMPROVE or OPTIMIZE an existing LLM agent's output quality - including improving tool selection accuracy, answer quality, reducing costs, or fixing issues where the agent gives wrong/incomplete responses. Evaluates agents systematically using MLflow evaluation with datasets, scorers, and tracing. Covers end-to-end evaluation workflow or individual components (tracing setup, dataset creation, scorer definition, evaluation execution).
