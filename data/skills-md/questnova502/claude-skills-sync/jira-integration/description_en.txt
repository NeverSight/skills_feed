Agent Skill: Comprehensive Jira integration through lightweight Python scripts. AUTOMATICALLY TRIGGER when user mentions Jira URLs like 'https://jira.*/browse/*', 'https://*.atlassian.net/browse/*', or issue keys like 'PROJ-123'. Use when searching issues (JQL), getting/updating issue details, creating issues, transitioning status, adding comments, logging worklogs, managing sprints and boards, creating issue links, or formatting Jira wiki markup. If authentication fails, offer to configure credentials interactively. Supports both Jira Cloud and Server/Data Center with automatic authentication detection. By Netresearch.
