Enforce code conventions that make codebases agent-friendly and self-healing. Inspired by Factory AI's "agent-native development" philosophy where lint rules and conventions act as guardrails for AI coding agents. Use this skill whenever generating, reviewing, or refactoring code in any language or framework. Triggers on: code generation, file creation, refactoring, code review, new features, bug fixes, migrations, or any task that produces source code. Covers file organization, naming, searchability, testing, error handling, logging, security, and architectural boundaries. Stack-specific references available for React, Vue, Angular, Laravel, .NET, Python, Go, Rust, and more.
