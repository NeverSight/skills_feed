Universal MCP client for connecting to any MCP server with progressive disclosure. Wraps MCP servers as skills to avoid context window bloat from tool definitions. Use when interacting with external MCP servers (Zapier, Sequential Thinking, GitHub, filesystem, etc.), listing available tools, or executing MCP tool calls. Triggers on requests like "connect to Zapier", "use MCP server", "list MCP tools", "call Zapier action", "use sequential thinking", or any MCP server interaction.
