Use when ready to implement designed features - breaks design into TDD tasks (Red-Green-Refactor), tracks progress with checkboxes in tasks.md, enforces strict testing discipline. Activates when user says "implement this", "let's code", "start execution", mentions "tasks", "TDD", or uses /dev-workflow:spec commands (tasks, execute).
