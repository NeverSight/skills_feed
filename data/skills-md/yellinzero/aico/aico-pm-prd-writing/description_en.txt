Create comprehensive Product Requirements Documents (PRD) that define what to build and why, focusing on goals, scope, user stories, and success criteria without implementation details.

Use this skill when:
- User asks to "write a PRD", "create PRD", "write requirements document"
- User mentions "requirements document", "product requirements", "product spec"
- Running /pm.plan command to create version planning document
- Starting a new product, major feature, or initiative that needs formal requirements
- Need to document goals, scope, user stories, functional requirements, and success criteria

Output: ALWAYS write PRD files to docs/reference/pm/versions/{version-name}.md
