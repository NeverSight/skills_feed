Work with Vercel Sandbox — ephemeral Linux microVMs for running untrusted code, AI agent output, and developer experimentation on Vercel. Use this skill when the user mentions "Vercel Sandbox", "@vercel/sandbox", sandbox microVMs, running code in isolated environments on Vercel, or wants to create/manage/snapshot sandboxes via the TypeScript/Python SDK or Vercel CLI. Also trigger when the user asks about sandbox pricing, resource limits, authentication (OIDC tokens, access tokens), system specifications, CLI commands (`vercel sandbox`), or wants to update the local documentation cache for this skill.
