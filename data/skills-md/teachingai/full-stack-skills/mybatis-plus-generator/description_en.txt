Provides comprehensive guidance for generating MyBatis-Plus code including Entity, Mapper, Service, ServiceImpl, 
Controller, DTO, VO, BO and other related objects from database tables. Use ONLY when the user explicitly 
mentions MyBatis-Plus, mybatis-plus-generator, or wants to generate code using MyBatis-Plus framework. 
This skill automatically generates standard CRUD methods and custom methods based on user requirements for 
MyBatis-Plus projects. Supports MVC and DDD architectures, Java and Kotlin languages. Do NOT trigger for 
generic code generation, JPA/Hibernate, or other ORM frameworks.
