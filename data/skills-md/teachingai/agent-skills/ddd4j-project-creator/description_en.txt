A comprehensive skill for creating new ddd4j (Domain-Driven Design for Java) projects based on ddd4j-boot framework. 
Use ONLY when the user explicitly mentions creating a ddd4j project, initializing ddd4j project, or setting up 
ddd4j-boot project. Supports three project types: single-module monolith, multi-module monolith, and microservices. 
Generates project scaffolding based on ddd4j-boot architecture with DDD, Hexagonal Architecture, Clean Architecture, 
and COLA V5 patterns. Do NOT trigger for generic DDD projects, JPA/Hibernate projects, or other ORM frameworks 
without explicit ddd4j mention.
