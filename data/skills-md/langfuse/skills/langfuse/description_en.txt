Interact with Langfuse and access its documentation. Use when needing to (1) query or modify Langfuse data programmatically via the CLI — traces, prompts, datasets, scores, sessions, and any other API resource, (2) look up Langfuse documentation, concepts, integration guides, or SDK usage, or (3) understand how any Langfuse feature works. This skill covers CLI-based API access (via npx) and multiple documentation retrieval methods.
