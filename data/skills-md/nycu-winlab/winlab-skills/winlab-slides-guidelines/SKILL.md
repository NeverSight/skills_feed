# WinLab Slides Guidelines

Review and guide WinLab presentation slides creation following WinLab guidelines. All requirements use RFC 2119 keywords (MUST, MUST NOT, REQUIRED, SHALL, SHALL NOT, SHOULD, SHOULD NOT, RECOMMENDED, MAY, OPTIONAL).

## RFC 2119 Keyword Definitions

When reviewing slides, interpret these keywords as defined in RFC 2119:

- **MUST / REQUIRED / SHALL**: Absolute requirement - the slide MUST comply or it is non-compliant
- **MUST NOT / SHALL NOT**: Absolute prohibition - the slide MUST NOT include this
- **SHOULD / RECOMMENDED**: Strong recommendation - valid reasons may exist to ignore, but implications must be understood
- **SHOULD NOT / NOT RECOMMENDED**: Strong recommendation against - may be acceptable in specific circumstances, but implications should be understood
- **MAY / OPTIONAL**: Truly optional - one may choose to include or omit

## Slide Title Requirements

- **MUST** have slide titles that clearly indicate what the slide intends to express
- **MUST** have unique slide titles (no duplicate titles)
- **MUST** have titles that directly address the slide's main topic
- **SHOULD** use suffix notation like "(1/2)", "(2/2)" when content spans multiple slides and cannot fit on a single slide

## Content Structure and Organization

- **SHOULD** organize overall structure from high-level concepts to detailed information
- **SHOULD** group related content together on the same slide or adjacent slides
- **SHOULD** reorganize content for presentation format (presentations cannot be read like articles with back-and-forth referencing)

## Bullet Points and Lists

- **MUST** make the hierarchical relationships between bullet list items clear
- **SHOULD** keep each item's description concise but clear
- **SHOULD** keep each item's text within one line (do not exceed one line per bullet point)

## Abbreviations and Terminology

- **MUST** provide full names for all English abbreviations
- **SHOULD** provide full names at least in the earlier slides of the presentation

## Diagrams and Process Flows

- **MUST** include step descriptions for flowcharts, pipelines, and any content related to step sequences or timing
