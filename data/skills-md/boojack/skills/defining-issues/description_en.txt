Converts vague natural-language requests into precise, grounded engineering issue definitions with background, issue statement, current state, non-goals, and open questions. Use when an issue needs to be clarified, scoped, or prepared before research or design work begins — such as unclear requirements, vague feature requests, ambiguous bug reports, or undefined scope boundaries.
