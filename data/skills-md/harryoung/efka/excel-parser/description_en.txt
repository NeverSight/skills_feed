Smart Excel/CSV file parsing with intelligent routing based on file complexity analysis. Analyzes file structure (merged cells, row count, table layout) using lightweight metadata scanning, then recommends optimal processing strategy - either high-speed Pandas mode for standard tables or semantic HTML mode for complex reports. Use when processing Excel/CSV files with unknown or varying structure where optimization between speed and accuracy is needed.
