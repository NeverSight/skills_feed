Create user-centered, accessible interface copy (microcopy) for digital products including buttons, labels, error messages, notifications, forms, onboarding, empty states, success messages, and help text. Use when writing or editing any text that appears in apps, websites, or software interfaces, designing conversational flows, establishing voice and tone guidelines, auditing product content for consistency and usability, reviewing UI strings, or improving existing interface copy. Applies UX writing best practices based on four quality standards — purposeful, concise, conversational, and clear. Includes accessibility guidelines, research-backed benchmarks (sentence length, comprehension rates, reading levels), expanded error patterns, tone adaptation frameworks, and comprehensive reference materials.
