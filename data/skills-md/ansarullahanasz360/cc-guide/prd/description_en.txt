Create self-verifying PRDs for autonomous execution. Interviews users to gather requirements, then generates structured prd.json with phased implementation and appropriate testing strategies. Supports 7 task categories with type-specific workflows. Use when user says "create a prd", "prd for", "plan a feature", "plan this", "write prd", or wants to plan any multi-step implementation work.
