Trigger when: (1) User mentions "manim" or "Manim Community" or "ManimCE", (2) Code contains `from manim import *`, (3) User runs `manim` CLI commands, (4) Working with Scene, MathTex, Create(), or ManimCE-specific classes.

Best practices for Manim Community Edition - the community-maintained Python animation engine. Covers Scene structure, animations, LaTeX/MathTex, 3D with ThreeDScene, camera control, styling, and CLI usage.

NOT for ManimGL/3b1b version (which uses `manimlib` imports and `manimgl` CLI).
