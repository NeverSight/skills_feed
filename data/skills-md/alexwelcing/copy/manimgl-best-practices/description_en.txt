Trigger when: (1) User mentions "manimgl" or "ManimGL" or "3b1b manim", (2) Code contains `from manimlib import *`, (3) User runs `manimgl` CLI commands, (4) Working with InteractiveScene, self.frame, self.embed(), ShowCreation(), or ManimGL-specific patterns.

Best practices for ManimGL (Grant Sanderson's 3Blue1Brown version) - OpenGL-based animation engine with interactive development. Covers InteractiveScene, Tex with t2c, camera frame control, interactive mode (-se flag), 3D rendering, and checkpoint_paste() workflow.

NOT for Manim Community Edition (which uses `manim` imports and `manim` CLI).
