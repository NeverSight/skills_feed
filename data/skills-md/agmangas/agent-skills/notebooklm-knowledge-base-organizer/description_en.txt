Use when preparing files for NotebookLM, organizing documents into a knowledge base, converting formats for NotebookLM compatibility, or reducing a large document collection to fit NotebookLM's 50-source limit. Scores and prioritizes sources, performs strategic merging (time-series, topic-based, format consolidation), converts unsupported formats (PPTX to PDF, XLSX to CSV), applies flat structure with descriptive snake_case names, and optimizes for RAG retrieval performance.
