Three.js 3D building system with spatial indexing, structural physics, and multiplayer networking. Use when creating survival games, sandbox builders, or any game with player-constructed structures. Covers performance optimization (spatial hash grids, octrees, chunk loading), structural validation (arcade/heuristic/realistic physics modes), and multiplayer sync (delta compression, client prediction, conflict resolution).
