Full-stack form handling for Inertia Rails: create, edit, delete, multi-step wizard, and file upload forms with validation errors and progress tracking. React examples inline; Vue and Svelte equivalents in references. Use when building any form, handling file uploads, multi-step forms, client-side validation, or wiring form submission to Rails controllers. NEVER react-hook-form. Use `<Form>` for simple forms, useForm for dynamic/programmatic control.
