One-time project initializer for Inertia Rails skills. Detects stack and frontend framework (React/Vue/Svelte) from Gemfile and package.json, offers to install recommended deps (alba-inertia, js-routes, pagy, shadcn), and generates a CLAUDE.md section that configures which skill patterns apply. Use when first installing these skills, bootstrapping a new Inertia Rails project, or when the stack changes.
