Alba serializers + Typelizer for type-safe Inertia Rails props with auto-generated TypeScript types. Use when serializing models for Inertia responses, setting up Alba resources, generating TypeScript types from Ruby, or using Inertia prop options (defer, once, merge, scroll) with Alba attributes. Replaces as_json with structured, auto-typed ApplicationResource, page resources, and shared props resources. When active, OVERRIDES the `render inertia: { ... }` pattern from other skills — use convention-based instance variable rendering instead.
