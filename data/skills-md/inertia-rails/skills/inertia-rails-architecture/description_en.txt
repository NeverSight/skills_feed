Server-driven architecture patterns for Inertia Rails + React. Load this FIRST when building any Inertia page or feature — it routes to the right skill. Decision matrix for data loading, forms, navigation, state management. NEVER useEffect+fetch, NEVER redirect_to for external URLs (use inertia_location), NEVER react-hook-form (use Form component). MUST invoke when adding pages, models with views, CRUD, or displaying data in an Inertia Rails app. ALWAYS `render inertia: { key: value }` to pass data — `@ivars` are NOT auto-passed as props.
