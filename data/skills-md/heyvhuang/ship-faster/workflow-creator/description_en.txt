Create workflow-* skills by composing existing skills into end-to-end chains. Turns a user idea into a workflow_spec.md SSOT (via workflow-brainstorm), discovers available skills locally + from skills.sh, and generates a new workflow-<slug>/ skill package. Use when you want to design a new workflow, chain multiple skills into a flow, or turn scattered atomic skills into a resumable plan-then-confirm workflow.
