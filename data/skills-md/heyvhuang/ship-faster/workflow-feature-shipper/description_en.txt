Use when you need to ship a single PR-sized feature end-to-end (plan -> implement -> verify) with artifacts. Ship core product features quickly in a Next.js codebase: turn a feature idea into an executable plan, implement in PR-sized slices, and keep artifacts under runs/ (or OpenSpec changes/ when available). Supports plan-only mode for early scoping. For prototype UI work, include a demo-ready wow moment (animation/micro-interaction) by default unless user opts out.
