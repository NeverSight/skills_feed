Billing and payment operations for Stripe: customers, products, prices, invoices, payment links, subscriptions, refunds, disputes, balance. Triggers: create customer, create product, create invoice, generate payment link, query transactions, process refunds, manage subscriptions, view disputes, check balance. Money operations require confirmation. MCP is optional — works with Dashboard/CLI too.
