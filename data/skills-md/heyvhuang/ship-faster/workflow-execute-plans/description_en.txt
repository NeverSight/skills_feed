Execute written implementation plans: first read and critically review the plan, then implement in small batches (default 3 tasks), produce verification evidence per batch and pause for feedback; must stop immediately and ask for help when blocked/tests fail/plan unclear. Trigger words: execute plan, implement plan, batch execution, follow the plan.
