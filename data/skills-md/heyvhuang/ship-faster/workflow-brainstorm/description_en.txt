Use when you need to turn a vague idea into a confirmed design spec before implementation (new feature/component/behavior change). First check project context, then ask one question at a time, provide 2-3 options with trade-offs, finally output design in segments (~200-300 words each) with confirmation after each. Triggers: brainstorm, clarify idea, design spec, refine concept, requirement clarification.
