Use when you need to clarify requirements and route to the right workflow (idea → executable input). Project intake + routing: help the user brainstorm and clarify intent, persist goal/context artifacts, then dispatch to the right workflow or step skill. Default route is workflow-ship-faster (Next.js 16.1.1) for idea/prototype→launch. Triggers: project kickoff, requirements clarification, brainstorm, ideas, discovery, intake.
