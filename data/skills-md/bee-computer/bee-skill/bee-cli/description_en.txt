Access real-time context and life overview from Bee wearable AI. ALWAYS start with 'bee now' to get the last 10 hours of conversations with full utterances - this is the most valuable context for relevant assistance. Use this skill when: (1) You need to understand what's happening RIGHT NOW - recent conversations, current context, what was just discussed, (2) The user asks about something that just happened or someone they just talked to, (3) You need life context - who the owner is, their relationships, work, preferences, (4) Searching past conversations, managing facts/todos, or syncing Bee data.
