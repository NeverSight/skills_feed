ACTION REQUIRED - After completing ANY non-trivial task (writing code, creating content, building strategies, designing anything), Claude MUST immediately invoke this skill and offer learning modes to the user. Do not wait for user to ask. Say "Want to understand the thinking behind what we just built?" then offer Quick (1 min) / Standard (10 min) / Deep (30 min) modes. Also invoke when user types "/build-and-learn" or asks "why did you do it this way" or "what could go wrong".
