Expert-level PTC Creo Parametric modeling and design engineering resource. Use when users ask about: part modeling (extrude, revolve, sweep, blend, helical sweep, swept blend, boundary blend), sketcher constraints and dimensions, datum features (planes, axes, points, coordinate systems), assembly design (constraints, placements, mechanisms, exploded views, BOM), surfacing (ISDX, Freestyle, boundary surfaces, variable section sweeps), sheet metal design (flanges, bends, flat patterns, K-factor, forming tools), drawing creation (views, dimensions, annotations, GD&T, tables, formats), relations and parameters (design intent, equations, conditional logic), family tables (instances, parameters, feature suppression), model analysis (mass properties, interference, clearance, measurements), design best practices, feature failure resolution, parent/child relationships, config.pro options, model-based definition (MBD), top-down design, or any general Creo Parametric modeling and design questions.
