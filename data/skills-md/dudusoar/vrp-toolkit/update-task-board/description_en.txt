Manage TASK_BOARD.md by reading project logs and synchronizing task status. Use when tasks are completed, when progress is made, or when needing to sync task tracking. Reads MIGRATION_LOG.md, DEBUG_LOG.md, GIT_LOG.md to assess actual progress and updates TASK_BOARD.md accordingly. Does NOT modify CLAUDE.md or MIGRATION_LOG.md.
