Build concise session context by extracting key information from project logs (CLAUDE.md, TASK_BOARD.md, MIGRATION_LOG.md, DEBUG_LOG.md, GIT_LOG.md, SKILLS_LOG.md) to provide token-efficient project status. Use when beginning work, returning after break, or needing quick project overview without reading full files.
