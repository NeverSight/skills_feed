Transform nebulous ideas into sharp, testable frameworks through multi-perspective dialectical interrogation. Use when developing vague intuitions, pressure-testing concepts, structuring half-formed frameworks, or distinguishing new ideas from existing concepts. Triggers include "explore this idea," "think through X," or "challenge my thinking."
