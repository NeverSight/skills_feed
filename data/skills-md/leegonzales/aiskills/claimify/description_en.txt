Extract and structure claims from discourse into analyzable argument maps with logical relationships and assumptions. Use when analyzing arguments, red-teaming reasoning, synthesizing debates, or transforming conversations into structured claim networks. Triggers include "what are the claims," "analyze this argument," "map the logic," or "find contradictions."
