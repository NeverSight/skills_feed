Capture the "Why" behind code changes during AI-assisted development. Creates branch-scoped markdown journals preserving reasoning, tradeoffs, and context that would otherwise be lost. Use before commits, PRs, or multi-file changes. Use when significant reasoning happened in conversation that should be preserved. Use when the user asks to document why a decision was made. Use when the user says "remember to journal", "anything to journal", or similar prompts.
