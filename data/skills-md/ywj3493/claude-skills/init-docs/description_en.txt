Initializes the standard docs/ directory structure for a new project. Creates docs/specifications/, docs/issue/, docs/reference/, docs/policy/, and docs/dev/ subdirectories, seeds initial policy documents in both English and Korean, and places a CLAUDE.md in the project root. Use this when starting a fresh project that should follow the standard documentation system.
