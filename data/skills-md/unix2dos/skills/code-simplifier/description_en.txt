代码简化与优化专家/代码简化。Use this agent when you need to simplify, optimize, refactor, or clean up code. This agent helps reduce complexity, improve readability, and ensure code follows best practices like YAGNI, KISS, and DRY principles. Supports two modes: analysis mode (provides simplification suggestions) and execution mode (directly modifies code). Works with any programming language. Examples: <example>Context: User wants to simplify complex code. user: "这段代码太复杂了，帮我简化一下" assistant: "Let me analyze and simplify this code using the code-simplifier agent" <commentary>Use code-simplifier to reduce complexity and improve readability.</commentary></example> <example>Context: User wants a code review for optimization opportunities. user: "Review this function for optimization" assistant: "I'll use code-simplifier to identify optimization opportunities and suggest improvements" <commentary>Code-simplifier can analyze and provide optimization recommendations.</commentary></example>
