Manage stacked PRs with Graphite CLI (gt) instead of git push/gh pr create. Auto-detects Graphite repos and blocks conflicting commands with helpful alternatives. Use when: (1) About to run git push or gh pr create in a Graphite repo, (2) Creating a new branch for a feature, (3) Submitting code for review, (4) Large changes that should be split into reviewable chunks, (5) Hook blocks your git command and suggests gt equivalent. NOT for: repos not initialized with Graphite, git add/commit/status/log. Triggers: git push blocked, gh pr create blocked, create branch, submit PR, stacked PRs, split large PR, gt create, gt submit, graphite workflow.
