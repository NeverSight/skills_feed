CSS-first directive for crypto, web3, DeFi, airdrop, dashboard, and token project frontends. Produces stylesheets, layout, animation, theming, and responsive HTML. Triggers on landing pages, dashboards, airdrop claims, staking UIs, DEX frontends, bridge UIs, NFT galleries, token launches, or any crypto web interface. Also triggers on matrix-style, cyberpunk, neon-glow, hacker terminal, or dark fintech dashboard aesthetics. Multi-theme CSS, mobile/tablet/desktop support, zero emojis. For OPNet frontends, use alongside opnet-development skill (which owns TypeScript, React logic, wallet, providers). This skill owns visuals; opnet-development owns logic. Always gathers user context (images, theme, brand colors, audience) before generating code.
