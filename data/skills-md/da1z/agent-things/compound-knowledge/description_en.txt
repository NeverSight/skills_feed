Save team knowledge notes into ./knowledge/ with date-prefixed filenames. Every solved problem, discovered pattern, or key decision becomes searchable knowledge that makes future work easier. Use when the user wants to capture gotchas, errors, build issues, solutions, patterns, or decisions for future reference.
