Build per-subsection writing briefs (NO PROSE) so later drafting is driven by evidence and checkable comparison axes (not outline placeholders).
**Trigger**: subsection briefs, writing cards, intent cards, H3 briefs, scope_rule, axes, clusters, 写作意图卡, 小节卡片, 段落计划.
**Use when**: `outline/outline.yml` + `outline/mapping.tsv` + `papers/paper_notes.jsonl` exist and you want section-by-section drafting without template leakage.
**Skip if**: `outline/subsection_briefs.jsonl` already exists and is refined (no placeholders/ellipsis; axes+clusters+paragraph_plan are filled).
**Network**: none.
**Guardrail**: NO PROSE; do not invent papers; only reference `paper_id`/`bibkey` that exist in `papers/paper_notes.jsonl`.
