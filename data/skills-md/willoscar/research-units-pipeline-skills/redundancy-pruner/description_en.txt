Remove repeated boilerplate across sections (methodology disclaimers, generic transitions, repeated summaries) while preserving citations and meaning.
**Trigger**: redundancy, repetition, boilerplate removal, 去重复, 去套话, 合并重复段落.
**Use when**: the draft feels rigid because the same paragraph shape and disclaimer repeats across many subsections.
**Skip if**: you are still drafting major missing sections (finish drafting first).
**Network**: none.
**Guardrail**: do not add/remove citation keys; do not move citations across subsections; do not delete subsection-specific content.
