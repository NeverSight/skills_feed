Define evidence-first table schemas for a survey: what each table must answer, row unit, columns, and which evidence-pack fields are required to fill it.
**Trigger**: table schema, schema-first tables, table design, 表格 schema, 先 schema 后填充.
**Use when**: you want survey tables that are verifiable and fillable before LaTeX (typically Stage C4, after evidence packs exist).
**Skip if**: `outline/table_schema.md` already exists and is refined (covers both index tables and Appendix tables; no placeholders; evidence mapping is explicit).
**Network**: none.
**Guardrail**: no invented facts; schema must be checkable and map each column to an evidence source.
