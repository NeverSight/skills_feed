Merge/simplify an over-fragmented outline to hit a paper-like section budget (NO PROSE): target final ToC ~6–8 H2, fewer thicker H3.
**Trigger**: outline budget, merge sections, too many sections, H3 explosion, 大纲预算, 合并小节, 大纲太碎.
**Use when**: `outline/outline.yml` exists but would produce thin sections (too many H2/H3); before (or immediately after) `section-mapper`.
**Skip if**: outline is already within budget and approved; or you are already drafting prose.
**Network**: none.
**Guardrail**: NO PROSE; do not invent new topics; keep scope consistent; if you change section ids, you must reset mapping.
