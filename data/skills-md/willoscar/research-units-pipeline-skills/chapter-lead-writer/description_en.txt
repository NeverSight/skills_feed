Write H2 chapter lead blocks (`sections/S<sec_id>_lead.md`) that preview the chapter\x27s comparison lens and connect its H3 subsections, without adding new facts.
**Trigger**: chapter lead writer, section lead writer, H2 lead, lead paragraph, 章节导读, 章节导语.
**Use when**: you have H2 chapters with multiple H3 subsections and the draft reads like \"paragraph islands\" across subsections.
**Skip if**: the outline has no H3 subsections, or `outline/chapter_briefs.jsonl` is missing (build briefs first).
**Network**: none.
**Guardrail**: no new facts/citations; no headings; no narration templates; use only citation keys present in `citations/ref.bib`.
