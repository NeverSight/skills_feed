Fill `outline/tables_index.md` from `outline/table_schema.md` + evidence packs (NO PROSE in cells; citation-backed rows).
**Trigger**: table filler, fill tables, evidence-first tables, index tables, 表格填充, 索引表.
**Use when**: table schema exists and evidence packs are ready; you want a compact, citation-backed index table to support later writing and Appendix table curation.
**Skip if**: `outline/tables_index.md` already exists and is refined (>=2 tables; citations in rows; no placeholders).
**Network**: none.
**Guardrail**: do not invent facts; every row must include citations; do not write paragraph cells.
