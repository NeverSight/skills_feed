Normalize cross-skill JSONL interfaces (ids + titles + citation key formats) so downstream skills do not rely on best-effort joins.
**Trigger**: schema normalize, jsonl contract, interface drift, join drift, 字段不一致, schema 规范化.
**Use when**: you have generated C2-C4 JSONL artifacts (outline/briefs/bindings/packs/anchors) and want deterministic, stable fields before self-loops/writing.
**Skip if**: you are not using the survey pipelines, or the workspace already has a fresh PASS `output/SCHEMA_NORMALIZATION_REPORT.md` for the current artifacts.
**Network**: none.
**Guardrail**: NO PROSE; deterministic transforms only; do not invent evidence/claims; only fill missing ids/titles from `outline/outline.yml`.
