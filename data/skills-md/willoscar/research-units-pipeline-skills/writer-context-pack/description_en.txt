Build per-H3 writer context packs (NO PROSE): merge briefs + evidence packs + anchor facts + allowed citations into a single deterministic JSONL, so drafting is less hollow and less brittle.
**Trigger**: writer context pack, context pack, drafting pack, paragraph plan pack, 写作上下文包.
**Use when**: `outline/subsection_briefs.jsonl` + `outline/evidence_drafts.jsonl` + `outline/anchor_sheet.jsonl` exist and you want to make C5 drafting easier/more consistent.
**Skip if**: upstream evidence is missing or scaffolded (fix `paper-notes` / `evidence-binder` / `evidence-draft` / `anchor-sheet` first).
**Network**: none.
**Guardrail**: NO PROSE; do not invent facts/citations; only use citation keys present in `citations/ref.bib`.
