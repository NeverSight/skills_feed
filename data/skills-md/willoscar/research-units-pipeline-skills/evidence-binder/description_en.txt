Bind addressable evidence IDs from `papers/evidence_bank.jsonl` to each subsection (H3), producing `outline/evidence_bindings.jsonl`.
**Trigger**: evidence binder, evidence plan, section->evidence mapping, 证据绑定, evidence_id.
**Use when**: `papers/evidence_bank.jsonl` exists and you want writer/auditor to use section-scoped evidence items (WebWeaver-style memory bank).
**Skip if**: you are not doing evidence-first section-by-section writing.
**Network**: none.
**Guardrail**: NO PROSE; do not invent evidence; only select from the existing evidence bank.
