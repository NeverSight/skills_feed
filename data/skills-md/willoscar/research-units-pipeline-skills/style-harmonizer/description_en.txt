De-slot and harmonize paper voice across `sections/*.md` without changing meaning or citation keys.
**Trigger**: style harmonizer, de-template stems, remove slot phrases, discourse stems, 写作风格统一, 去槽位句式, 去生成器味.
**Use when**: `writer-selfloop` is PASS but `output/WRITER_SELFLOOP_TODO.md` flags Style Smells (e.g., repeated count-based openers), or the draft reads like many sections share the same rhythm.
**Skip if**: you need new evidence/citations (route to C3/C4), or you are pre-C2 (NO PROSE).
**Network**: none.
**Guardrail**: do not invent facts; do not add/remove/move citation keys; do not move citations across subsections; keep claim->evidence anchoring intact.
