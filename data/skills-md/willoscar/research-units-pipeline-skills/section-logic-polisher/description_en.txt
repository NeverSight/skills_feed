Logic coherence pass for per-H3 section files: enforce a clear paragraph-1 thesis and surface paragraph-island risks (connector stats are diagnostic, not a quota) before merging.
**Trigger**: logic polisher, section logic, thesis statement, connectors, 段落逻辑, 连接词, 论证主线, 润色逻辑.
**Use when**: `sections/S*.md` exist but read like paragraph islands; you want a targeted, debuggable self-loop before `section-merger`.
**Skip if**: sections are missing/thin (fix `subsection-writer` first) or evidence packs/briefs are scaffolded (fix C3/C4 first).
**Network**: none.
**Guardrail**: do not add new citations; do not invent facts; do not change citation keys; do not move citations across subsections.
