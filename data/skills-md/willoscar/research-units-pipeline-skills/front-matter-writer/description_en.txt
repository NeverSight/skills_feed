Write the survey\x27s front matter files (Abstract, Introduction, Related Work, Discussion, Conclusion) in paper voice, with high citation density and a single evidence-policy paragraph.
**Trigger**: front matter writer, introduction writer, related work writer, abstract writer, discussion writer, conclusion writer, 引言, 相关工作, 摘要, 讨论, 结论.
**Use when**: you are in C5 (prose allowed) and need the paper-like \"shell\" to stop the draft reading like stitched subsections.
**Skip if**: `Approve C2` is missing in `DECISIONS.md`, or `citations/ref.bib` is missing (generate citations first).
**Network**: none.
**Guardrail**: no pipeline jargon in final prose; no repeated evidence disclaimers; do not invent facts/citations; only use keys present in `citations/ref.bib`.
