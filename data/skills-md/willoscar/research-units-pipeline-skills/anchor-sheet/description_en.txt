Extract per-subsection “anchor facts” (NO PROSE) from evidence packs so the writer is forced to include concrete numbers/benchmarks/limitations instead of generic summaries.
**Trigger**: anchor sheet, anchor facts, numeric anchors, evidence hooks, 写作锚点, 数字锚点, 证据钩子.
**Use when**: `outline/evidence_drafts.jsonl` exists and you want stronger, evidence-anchored writing in `sections/*.md`.
**Skip if**: evidence packs are incomplete (fix `evidence-draft` first).
**Network**: none.
**Guardrail**: NO PROSE; do not invent facts; only select from existing evidence snippets/highlights.
