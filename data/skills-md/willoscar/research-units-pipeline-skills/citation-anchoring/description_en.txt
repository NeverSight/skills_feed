Regression-check citation anchoring (citations stay in the same subsection) to prevent “polish drift” that breaks claim→evidence alignment.
**Trigger**: citation anchoring, citation drift, regression, cite stability, 引用锚定, 引用漂移.
**Use when**: after editing/polishing, you want to confirm citations did not migrate across `###` subsections.
**Skip if**: you do not have a baseline anchor file yet.
**Network**: none.
**Guardrail**: analysis-only; do not edit content.
