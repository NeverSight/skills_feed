Curate reader-facing survey tables for the Appendix (clean layout + high information density), using only in-scope evidence and existing citation keys.
**Trigger**: appendix tables, publishable tables, survey tables, reader tables, 附录表格, 可发表表格, 综述表格.
**Use when**: you have C4 artifacts (evidence packs + anchor sheet + citations) and want tables that look like a real survey (not internal logs).
**Skip if**: `outline/tables_appendix.md` already exists and is refined (>=2 tables; citation-backed; no placeholders; not index-y).
**Network**: none.
**Guardrail**: no invented facts; no pipeline jargon; no paragraph cells; use only keys present in `citations/ref.bib`.
