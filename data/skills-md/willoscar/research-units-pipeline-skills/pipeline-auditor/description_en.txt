Audit/regression checks for the evidence-first survey pipeline: citation health, per-section coverage, placeholder leakage, and template repetition.
**Trigger**: auditor, audit, regression test, quality report, 审计, 回归测试.
**Use when**: `output/DRAFT.md` exists and you want a deterministic PASS/FAIL report before LaTeX/PDF.
**Skip if**: you are still changing retrieval/outline/evidence packs heavily (audit later).
**Network**: none.
**Guardrail**: do not change content; only analyze and report.
