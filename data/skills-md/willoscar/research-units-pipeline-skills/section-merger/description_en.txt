Deterministically merge per-section files under `sections/` into `output/DRAFT.md`, preserving outline order and weaving transitions from `outline/transitions.md`.
**Trigger**: merge sections, merge draft, combine section files, sections/ -> output/DRAFT.md, 合并小节, 拼接草稿.
**Use when**: you have per-unit prose files under `sections/` and want a single `output/DRAFT.md` for polishing/review/LaTeX.
**Skip if**: section files are missing or still contain scaffolding markers (fix `subsection-writer` first).
**Network**: none.
**Guardrail**: deterministic merge only (no new facts/citations); preserve section order from `outline/outline.yml`.
