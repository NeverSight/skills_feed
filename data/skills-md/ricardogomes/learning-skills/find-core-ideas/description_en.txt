First-principles thinking; identify what everything else builds on. Use when a learner feels like they're memorizing rather than understanding, wants to distinguish foundational from derived concepts, or needs to reconstruct knowledge from basics. This skill guides through dependency testing (elimination, reconstruction, abstraction descent) while enforcing human-only reasoning about what's core vs. derived. Triggers on phrases like "I'm memorizing not understanding", "what's really foundational", "I can use it but don't understand why", "distinguish core from derived", or when a learner wants deeper understanding of first principles.
