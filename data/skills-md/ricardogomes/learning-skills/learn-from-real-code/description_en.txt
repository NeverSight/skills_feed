Teaches learners to extract transferable design lessons from real-world codebases through critical evaluation and systematic exploration. Use when a learner wants to study existing code to learn patterns, architecture, or design decisions—not just understand what it does. Guides through navigation, pattern recognition, critical evaluation (deliberate choice vs. compromise), and lesson extraction. Triggers on phrases like "learn from this codebase", "study how X is implemented", "understand design patterns in Y", or when a learner wants to improve by reading real code.
