Protect your deep work time. Calendar Audit scores every meeting on your calendar, calculates your deep work gap, and makes specific suggestions to reclaim focus time. Supports multiple calendar tools (screenshot, Google Calendar MCP, Apple Calendar, icalBuddy, gcalcli) and scoring frameworks (5-Dimension, Eisenhower, RACI, Value vs Effort, Custom). Value first — your first audit takes 2 minutes with just a screenshot. Just say "calendar-audit" to get going.
