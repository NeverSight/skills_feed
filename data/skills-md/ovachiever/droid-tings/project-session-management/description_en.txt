Track progress across work sessions using SESSION.md with git checkpoints and concrete next actions. Converts IMPLEMENTATION_PHASES.md into trackable session state with phase status, progress markers, and recovery points.

Use when: starting projects after planning phase, resuming work after context clears, managing multi-phase implementations, or troubleshooting lost context, missing progress tracking, or unclear next steps.
