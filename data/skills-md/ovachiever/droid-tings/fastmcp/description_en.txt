Build MCP servers in Python with FastMCP framework to expose tools, resources, and prompts to LLMs. Supports
storage backends (memory/disk/Redis), middleware, OAuth Proxy, OpenAPI integration, and FastMCP Cloud deployment.

Use when: creating MCP servers, defining tools or resources, implementing OAuth authentication, configuring
storage backends for tokens/cache, adding middleware for logging/rate limiting, deploying to FastMCP Cloud,
or troubleshooting module-level server, storage, lifespan, middleware order, circular imports, or OAuth errors.
