Build document Q&A and searchable knowledge bases with Google Gemini File Search - fully managed RAG with automatic chunking, embeddings, and citations. Upload 100+ file formats (PDF, Word, Excel, code), configure semantic search, and query with natural language.

Use when: building document Q&A systems, creating searchable knowledge bases, implementing semantic search without managing embeddings, indexing large document collections (100+ formats), or troubleshooting document immutability errors (delete+re-upload required), storage quota issues (3x input size for embeddings), chunking configuration (500 tokens/chunk recommended), metadata limits (20 key-value pairs max), indexing cost surprises ($0.15/1M tokens one-time), operation polling timeouts (wait for done: true), force delete errors, or model compatibility (Gemini 2.5 Pro/Flash only).
