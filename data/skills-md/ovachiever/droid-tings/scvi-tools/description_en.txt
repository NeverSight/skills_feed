This skill should be used when working with single-cell omics data analysis using scvi-tools, including scRNA-seq, scATAC-seq, CITE-seq, spatial transcriptomics, and other single-cell modalities. Use this skill for probabilistic modeling, batch correction, dimensionality reduction, differential expression, cell type annotation, multimodal integration, and spatial analysis tasks.
