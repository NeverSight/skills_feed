Cheminformatics toolkit for fine-grained molecular control. SMILES/SDF parsing, descriptors (MW, LogP, TPSA), fingerprints, substructure search, 2D/3D generation, similarity, reactions. For standard workflows with simpler interface, use datamol (wrapper around RDKit). Use rdkit for advanced control, custom sanitization, specialized algorithms.
