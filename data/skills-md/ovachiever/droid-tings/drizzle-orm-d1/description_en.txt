Build type-safe D1 databases with Drizzle ORM for Cloudflare Workers. Includes schema definition, migrations
with Drizzle Kit, relations, and D1 batch API patterns. Prevents 12 errors including SQL BEGIN failures.

Use when: defining D1 schemas, managing migrations, writing type-safe queries, implementing relations or
prepared statements, using batch API for transactions, or troubleshooting D1_ERROR, BEGIN TRANSACTION,
foreign keys, migration apply, or schema inference errors.

Prevents 12 documented issues: D1 transaction errors (SQL BEGIN not supported), foreign key
constraint failures during migrations, module import errors with Wrangler, D1 binding not found,
migration apply failures, schema TypeScript inference errors, prepared statement caching issues,
transaction rollback patterns, TypeScript strict mode errors, drizzle.config.ts not found,
remote vs local database confusion, and wrangler.toml vs wrangler.jsonc mixing.
