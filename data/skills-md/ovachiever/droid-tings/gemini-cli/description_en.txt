Consult Google Gemini CLI for second opinions on architecture, debugging, and security audits. Use Gemini's 1M+
context window for comprehensive code analysis. Compare Flash (fast) vs Pro (thorough) vs 3-Pro-Preview (cutting-edge).

Use when: need second opinion on architectural decisions, stuck debugging after 2+ attempts, writing security-
sensitive code, planning refactors (5+ files), approaching 70%+ context capacity, unfamiliar with tech stack,
need peer review, or want Flash vs Pro vs 3-Pro-Preview comparison.
