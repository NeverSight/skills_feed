Build authentication systems for TypeScript/Cloudflare Workers with social auth, 2FA, passkeys, organizations, and RBAC. Self-hosted alternative to Clerk/Auth.js.

IMPORTANT: Requires Drizzle ORM or Kysely for D1 - no direct D1 adapter. v1.4.0 (Nov 2025) adds stateless sessions, ESM-only (breaking), JWT key rotation, SCIM provisioning. v1.3 adds SSO/SAML, multi-team support.

Use when: self-hosting auth on Cloudflare D1, migrating from Clerk, implementing multi-tenant SaaS, or troubleshooting D1 adapter errors, session serialization, OAuth flows, TanStack Start cookie issues, nanostore session invalidation.
