Framework for computational fluid dynamics simulations using Python. Use when running fluid dynamics simulations including Navier-Stokes equations (2D/3D), shallow water equations, stratified flows, or when analyzing turbulence, vortex dynamics, or geophysical flows. Provides pseudospectral methods with FFT, HPC support, and comprehensive output analysis.
