Enforce Test-Driven Development (TDD) as the default workflow for code changes. Use this skill for feature implementation, bug fixes, refactoring, and any changes requiring correctness verification. Guides agents through Red-Green-Refactor cycles with proper test-first discipline. Triggers on requests like "implement feature," "fix bug," "refactor code," or any task mentioning tests, correctness, or behavior verification.
