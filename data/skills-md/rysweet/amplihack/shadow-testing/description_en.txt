Creates isolated container environments for testing local uncommitted changes before pushing.
Use when testing library changes, multi-repo coordination, or validating "works on my machine" → "works in CI".
Provides git bundle snapshots, embedded git server, selective URL rewriting, and package manager cache isolation.
Works with any coding agent via standalone CLI, shell scripts, or Docker Compose.
