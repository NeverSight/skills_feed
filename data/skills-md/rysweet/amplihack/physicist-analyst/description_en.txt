Analyzes events through physics lens using fundamental laws (thermodynamics, conservation, relativity),
quantitative modeling, systems dynamics, and energy principles to understand causation, constraints, and feasibility.
Provides insights on energy systems, physical limits, technological feasibility, and complex systems behavior.
Use when: Energy decisions, technology assessment, systems analysis, physical constraints, feasibility evaluation.
Evaluates: Energy flows, conservation laws, efficiency limits, physical feasibility, scaling behavior, emergent properties.
