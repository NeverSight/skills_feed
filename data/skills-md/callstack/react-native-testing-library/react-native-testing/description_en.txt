Covers: render, screen, queries (getBy/getAllBy/queryBy/findBy), Jest matchers, userEvent, fireEvent, waitFor, and async patterns. Supports v13 (React 18, sync render) and v14 (React 19+, async render). Triggers on: test files for React Native components, RNTL imports, mentions of "testing library", "write tests", "component tests", or "RNTL".
