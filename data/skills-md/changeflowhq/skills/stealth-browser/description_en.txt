Invisible Chrome automation for web scraping via CDP. Use when WebFetch fails or gets blocked (403, 429, Cloudflare, bot protection, JS-rendered pages). Launches your real Chrome install completely hidden, sends commands via Chrome DevTools Protocol. Sites see a normal browser with real extensions - no detectable automation. Learns which domains block and skips straight to stealth on future requests. Also handles form filling, clicking, screenshots, and scraping dynamic content.
