# Candid Loop

Run `candid-review` repeatedly until your code is clean. This skill automates the fix-review-fix cycle, applying fixes and re-running reviews until no issues remain (or max iterations is reached).

## Workflow

Execute these steps in order:

### Step 1: Load Configuration

Load loop configuration from CLI flags and config files.

**Precedence (highest to lowest):**
1. CLI flags
2. Project config (`.candid/config.json` → `loop` field)
3. User config (`~/.candid/config.json` → `loop` field)
4. Defaults

#### Check CLI Arguments

Parse CLI arguments for loop options:

| Flag | Description | Default |
|------|-------------|---------|
| `--mode <auto\|review-each\|interactive>` | Execution mode | `auto` |
| `--max-iterations <N>` | Maximum loop iterations | `5` |
| `--categories <list>` | Categories to enforce (comma-separated) | `all` |

**Valid modes:**
- `auto` - Automatically apply all fixes
- `review-each` - Go through each fix one by one (Yes/No for each)
- `interactive` - Full control with skip, ignore, and batch options

**Valid categories:** `critical`, `major`, `standards`, `smell`, `edge_case`, `architectural`, `all`

If CLI flags are provided, use them and skip config file checks for those specific options.

#### Check Project Config

Read `.candid/config.json` and extract the `loop` field:

```bash
jq -r '.loop // null' .candid/config.json 2>/dev/null
```

If the `loop` field exists:
- Extract `mode` if not set by CLI
- Extract `maxIterations` if not set by CLI
- Extract `enforceCategories` if not set by CLI
- Extract `ignored` object (categories, patterns, ids)

Output when loading from config: `Using loop settings from project config`

#### Check User Config

Same procedure for `~/.candid/config.json` if project config doesn't have `loop` field.

Output when loading from user config: `Using loop settings from user config`

#### Apply Defaults

For any options not set by CLI or config:

```
mode = "auto"
maxIterations = 5
enforceCategories = ["all"]
ignored = { categories: [], patterns: [], ids: [] }
```

### Step 2: Initialize Loop State

Set up tracking variables:

```
iteration = 0
totalFixesApplied = 0
allFixedIssues = []
```

Display mode banner:

**Auto mode:**
```
[Auto Mode] Running candid-loop with max [N] iterations...
```

**Review-each mode:**
```
[Review-Each Mode] Running candid-loop with max [N] iterations...
You will review each fix one by one.
```

**Interactive mode:**
```
[Interactive Mode] Running candid-loop with max [N] iterations...
Full control: skip, ignore, or batch process fixes.
```

### Step 3: Run Review Loop

Execute the main loop:

```
WHILE iteration < maxIterations:
    iteration++

    Execute Step 3.1 through Step 3.6

    IF exitLoop == true:
        BREAK

IF iteration >= maxIterations AND remainingIssues > 0:
    Output warning: "Max iterations ([N]) reached. [M] issues remain."
    List remaining issues
```

#### Step 3.1: Run candid-review

Display iteration header:
```
[Iteration [N]/[MAX]]
Running candid-review...
```

Invoke the candid-review skill to analyze current code:
- Use the Skill tool to run `/candid-review`
- Pass through tone settings if configured
- Wait for review to complete and save state to `.candid/last-review.json`

**Note:** candid-review will present its own fix selection prompt. In auto mode, we need to handle this by selecting "Apply all fixes". In interactive mode, we defer to the user's choices within candid-review.

#### Step 3.2: Read Review Results

After candid-review completes, read the saved review state:

```bash
cat .candid/last-review.json 2>/dev/null
```

Parse the JSON to extract:
- `issues` array with all found issues
- Each issue has: `id`, `file`, `line`, `category`, `title`, `description`

If file doesn't exist or is empty:
```
No review state found. candid-review may not have completed.
```
Exit with error.

#### Step 3.3: Filter Issues by Category

If `enforceCategories` is NOT `["all"]`:

Filter the issues array to only include issues matching enforceCategories:

```
filteredIssues = issues.filter(issue =>
    enforceCategories.includes(issue.category)
)
```

**Category mapping:**
- `critical` → issues with category "critical"
- `major` → issues with category "major"
- `standards` → issues with category "standards"
- `smell` → issues with category "smell"
- `edge_case` → issues with category "edge_case"
- `architectural` → issues with category "architectural"

Output: `Enforcing categories: [list]. Filtered to [N] issues.`

#### Step 3.4: Filter Out Ignored Issues

Apply the ignored filters from config:

**1. Filter by ignored categories:**
```
filteredIssues = filteredIssues.filter(issue =>
    !ignored.categories.includes(issue.category)
)
```

**2. Filter by ignored patterns (regex match on title):**
```
filteredIssues = filteredIssues.filter(issue =>
    !ignored.patterns.some(pattern =>
        new RegExp(pattern, 'i').test(issue.title)
    )
)
```

**3. Filter by ignored IDs:**
```
filteredIssues = filteredIssues.filter(issue =>
    !ignored.ids.includes(issue.id)
)
```

If any issues were filtered:
```
Filtered out [N] ignored issues ([M] remaining)
```

#### Step 3.5: Check for Completion

If `filteredIssues.length === 0`:

```
[Iteration [N]/[MAX]] No issues found!

exitLoop = true
```

Skip to Step 4 (Summary).

#### Step 3.6: Handle Issues Based on Mode

**If mode == "auto":**

Display found issues:
```
[N/MAX] Found [M] issues. Applying fixes...
```

The candid-review skill will have already applied fixes if the user selected "Apply all fixes" in its prompt. Since we're in auto mode, we should have configured candid-review to auto-apply.

For each issue that was fixed, log:
```
      ✓ [icon] Fixed: [title] in [file]:[line]
```

Track fixes:
```
totalFixesApplied += appliedCount
allFixedIssues.push(...appliedIssues)
```

Continue to next iteration.

**If mode == "review-each":**

Go through each fix one by one with simple Yes/No prompts.

Display found issues:
```
[N/MAX] Found [M] issues. Reviewing each...
```

For each issue, use AskUserQuestion:

```
[1/M] [icon] [title]
File: [file]:[line]
Problem: [description]
```

**Question:** "Apply this fix?"

**Options:**
1. "Yes, apply this fix"
2. "No, skip this fix"

Track user choices:
- If "Yes" → Apply the fix, increment totalFixesApplied
- If "No" → Continue to next issue

After processing all issues, if any fixes were applied, continue to next iteration.

**If mode == "interactive":**

Full control mode with additional options for skipping, ignoring, and batch processing.

Display found issues:
```
Found [M] issues:
```

For each issue, use AskUserQuestion:

```
[1/M] [icon] [title]
File: [file]:[line]
Problem: [description]
```

**Question:** "How would you like to handle this issue?"

**Options:**
1. "Apply fix" - Apply this fix and continue
2. "Skip" - Skip this issue and continue to next
3. "Add to ignore list" - Add this issue ID to ignored.ids and skip
4. "Skip all remaining" - Exit the loop with remaining issues listed

Track user choices:
- If "Apply fix" → Apply the fix, increment totalFixesApplied
- If "Skip" → Continue to next issue
- If "Add to ignore list" → Add issue.id to ignored.ids in config, continue
- If "Skip all remaining" → Set exitLoop = true, break inner loop

After processing all issues in interactive mode, if any fixes were applied, continue to next iteration.

### Step 3.7: Update Ignore List (If Requested)

If user chose "Add to ignore list" for any issues:

1. Read current `.candid/config.json` (or create if doesn't exist)
2. Add issue IDs to `loop.ignored.ids` array
3. Write updated config back to file

```bash
# Read, modify, write
jq '.loop.ignored.ids += ["issue-id-1", "issue-id-2"]' .candid/config.json > tmp.json
mv tmp.json .candid/config.json
```

Output: `Added [N] issues to ignore list in .candid/config.json`

### Step 4: Display Summary

After loop exits (success or max iterations), display final summary:

**Success (no issues remaining):**
```
Candid Loop Complete

Summary:
- Iterations: [N]
- Issues fixed: [M]
- Status: PASS

Your code is clean!
```

**Max iterations reached:**
```
Candid Loop Stopped

Summary:
- Iterations: [N] (max reached)
- Issues fixed: [M]
- Issues remaining: [P]
- Status: INCOMPLETE

Remaining issues:
  [icon] [title] in [file]:[line]
  [icon] [title] in [file]:[line]
  ...

Consider:
- Increasing --max-iterations
- Adding persistent ignores for false positives
- Manually reviewing complex issues
```

**User cancelled (interactive mode):**
```
Candid Loop Cancelled

Summary:
- Iterations: [N]
- Issues fixed: [M]
- Issues skipped: [P]
- Status: CANCELLED

Skipped issues:
  [icon] [title] in [file]:[line]
  ...
```

## Configuration

### Config File Schema

Add to `.candid/config.json`:

```json
{
  "version": 1,
  "tone": "harsh",
  "loop": {
    "mode": "auto",
    "maxIterations": 5,
    "enforceCategories": ["all"],
    "ignored": {
      "categories": [],
      "patterns": [],
      "ids": []
    }
  }
}
```

### Field Descriptions

| Field | Type | Default | Description |
|-------|------|---------|-------------|
| `loop.mode` | string | `"auto"` | `"auto"`, `"review-each"`, or `"interactive"` |
| `loop.maxIterations` | number | `5` | Maximum review-fix cycles |
| `loop.enforceCategories` | array | `["all"]` | Categories to enforce |
| `loop.ignored.categories` | array | `[]` | Categories to skip entirely |
| `loop.ignored.patterns` | array | `[]` | Regex patterns to match issue titles |
| `loop.ignored.ids` | array | `[]` | Specific issue IDs to skip |

### Examples

**Ignore all edge cases and architectural issues:**
```json
{
  "loop": {
    "ignored": {
      "categories": ["edge_case", "architectural"]
    }
  }
}
```

**Ignore issues mentioning Unicode or timezone:**
```json
{
  "loop": {
    "ignored": {
      "patterns": ["Unicode", "timezone", "DST"]
    }
  }
}
```

**Only enforce critical and major issues:**
```json
{
  "loop": {
    "enforceCategories": ["critical", "major"]
  }
}
```

## CLI Examples

```bash
# Run with defaults (auto mode, all categories, max 5 iterations)
/candid-loop

# Review-each mode - go through each fix one by one (Yes/No)
/candid-loop --mode review-each

# Interactive mode - full control with skip, ignore, batch options
/candid-loop --mode interactive

# Limit iterations
/candid-loop --max-iterations 3

# Only fix critical issues
/candid-loop --categories critical

# Fix critical and major issues
/candid-loop --categories critical,major

# Combine options
/candid-loop --mode review-each --max-iterations 10 --categories critical,major
```

## Issue Categories Reference

| Category | Icon | Description |
|----------|------|-------------|
| `critical` | 🔥 | Production killers: crashes, security holes, data loss |
| `major` | ⚠️ | Serious problems: performance, missing error handling |
| `standards` | 📜 | Technical.md violations |
| `smell` | 📋 | Maintainability: complexity, duplication |
| `edge_case` | 🤔 | Unhandled scenarios: null, empty, concurrent |
| `architectural` | 💭 | Design concerns: coupling, SRP violations |

## Remember

The goal of candid-loop is to **automate the review-fix cycle** so you can quickly get your code to a clean state.

**Mode selection:**
- **auto** - Fast iteration, applies all fixes automatically
- **review-each** - Go through each fix one by one with simple Yes/No
- **interactive** - Full control with skip, ignore list, and batch options

**Best practices:**
- Start with auto mode for quick cleanup
- Use review-each mode to understand what's being fixed
- Use interactive mode when you need to ignore or skip specific issues
- Add patterns to ignore list for known false positives
- Keep maxIterations reasonable (5-10) to avoid infinite loops
- Review the summary to understand what was fixed
