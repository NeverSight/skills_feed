Fetch, organize, and analyze LangSmith traces for debugging and evaluation. Use when you need to: query traces/runs by project, metadata, status, or time window; download traces to JSON; organize outcomes into passed/failed/error buckets; analyze token/message/tool-call patterns; compare passed vs failed behavior; or investigate benchmark and production failures.
