Implement multi-agent coordination patterns (supervisor-subagent, router, orchestrator-worker, handoffs) for LangGraph applications. Use when users want to (1) implement multi-agent systems, (2) coordinate multiple specialized agents, (3) choose between coordination patterns, (4) set up supervisor-subagent workflows, (5) implement router-based agent selection, (6) create parallel orchestrator-worker patterns, (7) implement agent handoffs, (8) design state schemas for multi-agent systems, or (9) debug multi-agent coordination issues.
