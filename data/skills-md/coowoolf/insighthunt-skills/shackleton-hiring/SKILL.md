# Shackleton-Style Team Building

## Overview

A high-intensity hiring filter inspired by Ernest Shackleton's Antarctica expedition advertisement. Explicitly discourages those seeking comfort and attracts **obsessive, high-agency generalists** who thrive on urgency.

**Core principle:** Promise difficult missions and honor, not comfort.

## The Filter

## Do's and Don'ts

| ✓ Hire For | ✗ Filter Out |
|------------|--------------|
| Thrive under high urgency | Seek comfortable work |
| Seek difficult missions | View role as "just a job" |
| Generalist with one superpower | Narrow craft specialists only |
| Obsess over product & team | Act as "passenger" |

## Common Mistakes

- Hiring for narrow crafts instead of generalist agency
- Failing to set intensity expectations upfront
- Attracting comfort-seekers with generic JDs
