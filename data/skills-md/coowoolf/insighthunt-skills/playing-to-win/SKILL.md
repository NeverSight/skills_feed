# Playing to Win Framework

## Overview

A strategic framework to create focus by making an **integrated set of choices** about where the product will compete and how it will succeed, rather than trying to be everything to everyone.

**Core principle:** Strategy is an integrated set of choices, not a list of goals.

## The Four Steps

```
┌─────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────┐
│  1. DEFINE WINNING ASPIRATION                                   │
│     What does "winning" look like for us?                       │
├─────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────┤
│  2. CHOOSE WHERE TO PLAY                                        │
│     Markets / Segments / Personas                               │
│     Be SPECIFIC (not "everyone")                                │
├─────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────┤
│  3. DETERMINE HOW TO WIN                                        │
│     Value proposition / Differentiation                         │
│     What makes us win in that market?                           │
├─────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────┤
│  4. EXECUTE                                                     │
│     Build capabilities and systems                              │
│     Align team around choices                                   │
└─────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────┘
```

## Key Principles

| Principle | Description |
|-----------|-------------|
| **Explicit choices** | Where to Play AND How to Win |
| **Integration** | Choices must reinforce each other |
| **Focus** | Saying "no" is as important as saying "yes" |
| **Specific targets** | Name the segments, not "broad market" |

## Common Mistakes

- Skipping "Where to Play" and building for everyone
- Building features for every user type
- Strategy = goal list rather than integrated choices
