# Marginal User Framework

## Overview

A method for identifying high-leverage product improvements by focusing on the user **"on the cusp"** of conversion or the **"worst-case scenario"** user. Solving for the user with the most friction often resolves hidden issues for everyone.

**Core principle:** If you solve for the hardest user, you unlock growth for everyone.

## When to Use

- High traffic but low conversion
- Expanding into new international markets
- Data funnels not revealing friction points
- Growth has plateaued unexpectedly

## The Five-Step Process

```
┌─────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────┐
│  1. IDENTIFY      →  Find "Worst Case" User                    │
│                      (bad device, slow network, language gap)  │
├─────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────┤
│  2. OBSERVE       →  Watch them try to use it (qualitative)    │
│                      Don't rely solely on analytics            │
├─────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────┤
│  3. INVENTORY     →  List ALL friction points encountered      │
│                      (latency, language, UI complexity)        │
├─────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────┤
│  4. FILTER        →  Which fixes help the "marginal" user?     │
│                      (next-most-likely to convert)             │
├─────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────┤
│  5. EXECUTE       →  Remove barriers for many by solving       │
│                      for the few                               │
└─────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────┘
```

## Quick Reference

| Worst-Case Dimension | What to Look For |
|---------------------|------------------|
| Device | Feature phones, low RAM |
| Network | 2G/Edge, high latency |
| Language | Non-primary language users |
| Tech Literacy | First-time smartphone users |
| Accessibility | Vision/motor impairments |

## Common Mistakes

- **Only using analytics** → Observe users qualitatively
- **Optimizing for average** → The "average" user doesn't reveal bottlenecks
- **Ignoring edge cases** → Edge cases are the growth lever

## Real-World Example

At Facebook, Adriel Frederick analyzed users on feature phones with Edge connections. He discovered the issues were language barriers and latency. Fixing latency for the "worst case" improved speed for the entire user base.
