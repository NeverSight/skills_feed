# Values-Based Inner Scorecard

## Overview

A framework adapted from Warren Buffett to distinguish between **external validation** (Outer Scorecard) and **internal satisfaction** (Inner Scorecard). Helps you avoid the trap of optimizing for others' expectations.

**Core principle:** Draw a line from your current path forward—does it hit YOUR values or someone else's?

## The Two Scorecards

```
┌─────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────┐
│  INNER SCORECARD (Values)    │  OUTER SCORECARD (Ego Monster)  │
├──────────────────────────────┼──────────────────────────────────┤
│  ✓ Relationships & Kindness  │  ✗ Job Titles & Hierarchy       │
│  ✓ Autonomy & Independence   │  ✗ External Status/Fame         │
│  ✓ Learning & Curiosity      │  ✗ Wealth as primary goal       │
│  ✓ Internal peace/alignment  │  ✗ Meeting others' expectations │
└──────────────────────────────┴──────────────────────────────────┘
```

## The Process

1. **Define your values**: Select from a list, group them, stack-rank top 3-5
2. **Identify the Ego Monster**: Recognize when optimizing for Outer Scorecard
3. **Audit decisions**: Draw a line forward—where does this path lead?
4. **Prioritize alignment**: Optimize for your stack-ranked values over resume optics

## Quick Decision Check

| Question | Inner | Outer |
|----------|-------|-------|
| Why do I want this? | Meaning | Status |
| Who will be impressed? | Me | Others |
| In 10 years? | Fulfilled | Trapped |

## Common Mistakes

- **Ego Monster override**: Letting status override core values
- **Equal weighting**: Not stack-ranking values (treating all as equal)
- **No audit**: Never checking if path aligns with values

## Real-World Example

Lenny realized through this exercise that "Choose Adventure" and "Simplicity" were core values. This helped him say no to writing a book—despite it being the "obvious" next career step.
