# Navigating Organizational Kayfabe

## Overview

A framework for surviving and influencing large organizations by acknowledging **Kayfabe** (the shared fake reality/optimism) without becoming a zombie or a martyr.

**Core principle:** Maintain a "split brain"—play the role required by the org while making decisions based on ground truth internally.

## Do's and Don'ts

| ✓ Do | ✗ Don't |
|------|---------|
| Maintain split brain (Role vs. Truth) | Smash the "Ground Truth Button" |
| Nudge system incrementally | Believe the Kayfabe earnestly |
| Use "I wonder if..." framing | Become cynical or disengage |
| Accept Kayfabe as survival mechanic | Assume leaders are bad actors |

## Safe Truth-Telling Phrases

Instead of direct confrontation:
- "I wonder if we're missing something..."
- "What if we considered..."
- "I'm curious about the assumptions here..."

## Common Mistakes

- **Cynicism**: Checking out completely
- **Radical truth-telling**: Getting "tackled" by org immune system
- **Zombie state**: Earnestly believing the fake narrative

## Real-World Example

A project status is "yellow" but reported as "green" because it will be fixed by the time leadership sees it. This compounds up 5 layers, creating total disconnection from reality at the top.
