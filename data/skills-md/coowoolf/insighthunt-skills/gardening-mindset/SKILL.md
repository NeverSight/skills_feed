# The Gardening Mindset

## Overview

A shift from the **"Builder" mindset** (rigid plans, top-down control) to a **"Gardener" mindset** (creating conditions for growth, ecosystem curation). Plant many cheap "seeds" and invest in the ones that show organic traction.

**Core principle:** Don't try to predict the winner. Look for signals of natural growth.

## Builder vs Gardener

```
┌─────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────┐
│  BUILDER MINDSET              │  GARDENER MINDSET              │
├───────────────────────────────┼─────────────────────────────────┤
│  Fixed Plan & Execution       │  Emergence & Adaptation        │
│  Top-Down Control             │  Ecosystem Curation            │
│  Efficiency Focused           │  Resilience Focused            │
│  Failure = Waste              │  Failure = Cheap Learning      │
│  Industrial/Factory Farming   │  Community Gardening           │

## The 70/30 Rule

| Allocation | Purpose |
|------------|---------|
| **70%** | Legible, "boring" value (buy cover, build trust) |
| **30%** | Plant "acorns" with compounding potential |

## Key Principles

1. **Don't predict winners**: Look for signals of natural growth
2. **Cheap seeds**: Hours, not months of investment
3. **Protect seedlings**: Shield experiments from "squirrels" (org immune system)
4. **Invest in traction**: When something grows, pour resources into it

## Common Mistakes

- **Expecting immediate ROI** on every seed
- **Forcing growth**: Trying to make a specific seed succeed
- **No cover fire**: Failing to provide legible value to buy space for experiments

## Real-World Example

Building an open-source tool: if a developer uses it, invest more. If not, the cost was low (hours, not months). Done properly, it looks like magic—emergent success rather than forced outcomes.
