# The Founder Prenup

## Overview

A set of critical discussion topics for co-founders to align on **before** starting a company (or to revisit periodically). Designed to prevent the **65% of startup failures** caused by co-founder conflict.

**Core principle:** Assume nothing. If you act based on your values and they act based on theirs, you'll think they're acting strangely—but they're just being themselves.

## The Alignment Checklist

## When to Use

| Timing | Purpose |
|--------|---------|
| Before incorporation | Foundational alignment |
| When adding co-founder | Prevent future conflicts |
| Annually | Relationship health check |
| During tension | Structured de-escalation |

## Red Flag Misalignments

| Topic | Co-founder A | Co-founder B | Risk |
|-------|--------------|--------------|------|
| End Goal | IPO | Lifestyle biz | **Critical** |
| Work Style | 80hr weeks | 40hrs max | **High** |
| Decision | Consensus | Dictatorial | **High** |
| Conflict | Avoid | Confront | **Medium** |

## Common Mistakes

- **Assuming alignment** because you're friends
- **Avoiding the conversation** because it feels awkward
- **Not revisiting** as the company evolves

## Real-World Example

Two co-founders realized too late: one wanted a massive venture outcome, the other wanted a small shop where they knew everyone's name. The painful split could have been avoided with this conversation upfront.
