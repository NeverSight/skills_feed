Use this skill when building Model Context Protocol (MCP) servers on Cloudflare Workers. This skill should be used when deploying remote MCP servers with TypeScript, implementing OAuth authentication (GitHub, Google, Azure, etc.), using Durable Objects for stateful MCP servers, implementing WebSocket hibernation for cost optimization, or configuring dual transport methods (SSE + Streamable HTTP). The skill prevents 15+ common errors including McpAgent class export issues, OAuth redirect URI mismatches, WebSocket state loss, Durable Objects binding errors, and CORS configuration mistakes. Includes production-tested templates for basic MCP servers, OAuth proxy integration, stateful servers with Durable Objects, and complete wrangler.jsonc configurations. Covers all 4 authentication patterns: token validation, remote OAuth with DCR, OAuth proxy (workers-oauth-provider), and full OAuth provider implementation. Self-contained with Worker and Durable Objects basics. Token efficiency: ~87% savings (40k → 5k tokens). Production tested on Cloudflare's official MCP servers.
