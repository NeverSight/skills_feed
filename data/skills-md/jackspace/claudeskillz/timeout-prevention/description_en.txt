Prevent request timeouts in Claude Code sessions by chunking long operations, implementing progress checkpoints, using background processes, and optimizing tool usage patterns. Use when performing bulk operations, processing large datasets, running long-running commands, downloading multiple files, or executing tasks that exceed 2-minute timeout limits. Implements strategies like task decomposition, incremental processing, parallel execution, checkpoint-resume patterns, and efficient resource management to ensure reliable completion of complex workflows.
