Infer gene regulatory networks (GRNs) from gene expression data using scalable algorithms (GRNBoost2, GENIE3). Use when analyzing transcriptomics data (bulk RNA-seq, single-cell RNA-seq) to identify transcription factor-target gene relationships and regulatory interactions. Supports distributed computation for large-scale datasets.
