Production-ready skill for integrating TheSys C1 Generative UI API into React applications. This skill should be used when building AI-powered interfaces that stream interactive components (forms, charts, tables) instead of plain text responses. Covers complete integration patterns for Vite+React, Next.js, and Cloudflare Workers with OpenAI, Anthropic Claude, and Cloudflare Workers AI. Includes tool calling with Zod schemas, theming, thread management, and production deployment. Prevents 12+ common integration errors and provides working templates for chat interfaces, data visualization, and dynamic forms. Use this skill when implementing conversational UIs, AI assistants, search interfaces, or any application requiring real-time generative user interfaces with streaming LLM responses.
