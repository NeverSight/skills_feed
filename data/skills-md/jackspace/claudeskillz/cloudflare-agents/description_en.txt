Comprehensive guide for the Cloudflare Agents SDK - build AI-powered autonomous agents on Workers + Durable Objects.

Use when: building AI agents, creating stateful agents with WebSockets, implementing chat agents with streaming, scheduling tasks with cron/delays, running asynchronous workflows, building RAG (Retrieval Augmented Generation) systems with Vectorize, creating MCP (Model Context Protocol) servers, implementing human-in-the-loop workflows, browsing the web with Browser Rendering, managing agent state with SQL, syncing state between agents and clients, calling agents from Workers, building multi-agent systems, or encountering Agent configuration errors.

Prevents 15+ documented issues: migrations not atomic, missing new_sqlite_classes, Agent class not exported, binding name mismatch, global uniqueness gotchas, WebSocket state handling, scheduled task callback errors, state size limits, workflow binding missing, browser binding required, vectorize index not found, MCP transport confusion, authentication bypassed, instance naming errors, and state sync failures.
