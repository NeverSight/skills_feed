This skill provides complete coverage of Google Gemini embeddings API (gemini-embedding-001) for building RAG systems, semantic search, document clustering, and similarity matching. Use when implementing vector search with Google's embedding models, integrating with Cloudflare Vectorize, or building retrieval-augmented generation systems. Covers SDK usage (@google/genai), fetch-based Workers implementation, batch processing, 8 task types (RETRIEVAL_QUERY, RETRIEVAL_DOCUMENT, SEMANTIC_SIMILARITY, etc.), dimension optimization (128-3072), and cosine similarity calculations. Prevents 8+ embedding-specific errors including dimension mismatches, incorrect task types, rate limiting issues (100 RPM free tier), vector normalization mistakes, text truncation (2,048 token limit), and model version confusion. Includes production-ready RAG patterns with Cloudflare Vectorize integration, chunking strategies, and caching patterns. Token savings: ~60%. Production tested.
