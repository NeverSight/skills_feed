Type-safe ORM for Cloudflare D1 databases using Drizzle. This skill provides comprehensive
patterns for schema definition, migrations management, type-safe queries, relations, and
Cloudflare Workers integration.

Use when: building D1 database schemas, writing type-safe SQL queries, managing database
migrations with Drizzle Kit, defining table relations, implementing prepared statements,
using D1 batch API for transactions, or encountering "D1_ERROR", transaction errors,
foreign key constraint failures, migration apply errors, or schema inference issues.

Prevents 12 documented issues: D1 transaction errors (SQL BEGIN not supported), foreign key
constraint failures during migrations, module import errors with Wrangler, D1 binding not found,
migration apply failures, schema TypeScript inference errors, prepared statement caching issues,
transaction rollback patterns, TypeScript strict mode errors, drizzle.config.ts not found,
remote vs local database confusion, and wrangler.toml vs wrangler.jsonc mixing.
