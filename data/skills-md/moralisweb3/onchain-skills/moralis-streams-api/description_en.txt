Real-time blockchain event monitoring with webhooks. Use when user asks about setting up webhooks, real-time event streaming, monitoring wallet addresses, tracking token transfers in real-time, listening to all addresses on a chain, creating/updating/deleting streams, adding/removing addresses from streams, or receiving blockchain events as they happen. Supports all EVM chains. NOT for querying historical or current blockchain state - use moralis-data-api instead.
