This skill should be used as a mandatory final sanity check before git commit, PR creation, or declaring work done. Triggers on "commit", "push", "PR", "pull request", "done", "finished", "complete", "ship", "deploy", "ready to merge". Catches security vulnerabilities, logic errors, and business rule bugs that slip through despite passing tests.
