Use this skill when working with personal dotfiles managed by yadm. This includes pulling remote changes, committing and pushing dotfile changes, modifying configuration files (shell, editor, terminal, git, etc.), viewing tracked files, resolving merge conflicts, and maintaining the dotfiles repository. For work dotfiles, use the managing-work-dotfiles skill instead.
