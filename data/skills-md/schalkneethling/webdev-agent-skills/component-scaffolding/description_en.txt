Generate Drupal/Twig component skeletons with web components and Miyagi validation. Use when user requests to create, scaffold, or add a new component at a specific path (e.g., "add component skeleton at patterns/share-button"), or when creating component files including Twig templates, CSS, JavaScript web components, JSON schemas, or mock data files.
