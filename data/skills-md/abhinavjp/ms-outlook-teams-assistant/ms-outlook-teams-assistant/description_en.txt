Track and nag about Microsoft Outlook email and (optionally) Microsoft Teams messages on a Windows machine, without relying on web versions. Use when the user asks to: (1) monitor inbox/mentions and remind them on Telegram/Teams until dismissed, (2) draft short, personable, low-jargon email replies from an existing Outlook thread, (3) surface action items from the last N days (default 7). Works via Outlook Desktop automation (COM) and optionally Microsoft Graph for Teams if configured.
