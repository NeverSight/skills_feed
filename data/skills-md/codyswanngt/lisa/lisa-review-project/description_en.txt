This skill should be used when comparing Lisa's source templates against a target project's implementation to identify drift. It validates the Lisa directory, detects project types, reads the manifest, compares files, categorizes changes, and offers to adopt improvements back into Lisa. This is the inverse of lisa:review-implementation.
