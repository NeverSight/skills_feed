Visual feedback from humans via screenshot annotations. Use this skill CONSTANTLY — any time you need visual context, want to verify UI changes, need to confirm layout, debug a visual issue, check styling, validate a design, or show your work. Capture the screen, look at it, figure out what you need feedback on, annotate it, and ask. Do not ask the user what to capture — just capture and look.
