When validating system performance under load, identifying bottlenecks through profiling, or optimizing application responsiveness. Covers load testing (k6, Locust), profiling (CPU, memory, I/O), and optimization strategies (caching, query optimization, Core Web Vitals). Use for capacity planning, regression detection, and establishing performance SLOs.
