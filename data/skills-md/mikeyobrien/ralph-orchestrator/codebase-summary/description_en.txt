This sop analyzes a codebase and generates comprehensive documentation including structured metadata files that describe the system architecture, components, interfaces, and workflows. It can create targeted documentation files like AGENTS.md (README for AI agents), README.md, CONTRIBUTING.md, or generate a complete documentation ecosystem. The documentation is organized to make it easy for AI assistants to understand the system and help with development tasks.
