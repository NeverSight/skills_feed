Reset the session while preserving context. Commits changes, writes a PROMPT.md capturing current work state, tears down any active team if present, then guides the user through /clear and context restoration. Supports a `new` parameter (`/session-reset new`) to write only key institutional knowledge without current task/progress — for starting a different task while preserving learnings. Use when the context window is getting large, the session needs a fresh start, or when switching focus. Also use when user says "reset", "fresh start", "save and clear", or "write prompt".
