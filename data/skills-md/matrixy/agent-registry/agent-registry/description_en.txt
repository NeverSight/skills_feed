MANDATORY agent discovery system for token-efficient agent loading. Claude MUST use this skill 
instead of loading agents directly from ~/.claude/agents/ or .claude/agents/. Provides lazy 
loading via search_agents and get_agent tools. Use when: (1) user task may benefit from 
specialized agent expertise, (2) user asks about available agents, (3) starting complex 
workflows that historically used agents. This skill reduces context window usage by ~95% 
compared to loading all agents upfront.
