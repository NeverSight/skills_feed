Improve an existing skill based on conversation context and user feedback. Use when:
(1) User says "/improve-skill <skill-name>" or "improve the skill" after using a skill
(2) User wants to refine a skill based on corrections made during conversation
(3) User provides specific feedback about what a skill should do differently
(4) User wants to make a skill more tailored to their preferences or workflow

This skill analyzes the conversation history to identify course corrections, misunderstandings,
and user preferences, then updates the target skill's SKILL.md and resources accordingly.
