Sequential reasoning with deep self-reflection and backtracking. Use when problems have step-by-step dependencies, need careful logical reasoning, or require error correction. Each step includes self-reflection, and incorrect steps trigger backtracking. Ideal for debugging, mathematical proofs, sequential planning, or causal analysis where order matters.
