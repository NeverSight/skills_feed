Analyze Flux CD GitOps repositories for structure, validation, API compliance, and best practices. Use this skill whenever the user asks to analyze, review, audit, validate, or check a GitOps repository. Also use it when users mention Flux repo structure, GitOps best practices, manifest validation, deprecated APIs, or repository organization — even if they don't explicitly say "analyze".
