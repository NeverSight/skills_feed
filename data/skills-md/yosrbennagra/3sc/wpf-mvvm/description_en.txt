Build and maintain WPF MVVM patterns using CommunityToolkit.Mvvm for a .NET 8 widget-host app. Use when creating ViewModels, commands, observable state, validation, view bindings, and viewmodel-first navigation behaviors. Avoid Prism and heavy region managers; keep ViewModels testable and UI-agnostic.
