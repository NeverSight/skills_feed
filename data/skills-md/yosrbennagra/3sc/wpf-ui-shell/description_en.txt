Create or refactor a .NET 8 WPF shell for a desktop widget host using CommunityToolkit.Mvvm and a custom viewmodel-first navigation service. Use when working on App.xaml, MainWindow/ShellWindow, shared ResourceDictionaries, runtime Light/Dark theming, or shell layout for widget-style apps. Avoid Prism, Frame navigation, and heavy region managers.
