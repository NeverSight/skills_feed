Create custom directives in Angular v20+ for DOM manipulation and behavior extension. Use for attribute directives that modify element behavior/appearance, structural directives for portals/overlays, and host directives for composition. Triggers on creating reusable DOM behaviors, extending element functionality, or composing behaviors across components. Note - use native @if/@for/@switch for control flow, not custom structural directives.
