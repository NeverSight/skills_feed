Use when generating images with Midjourney, constructing MJ prompts, iterating on MJ output quality, choosing between --sref/--oref/style codes, scoring image results, or building reusable prompt patterns. Also use when exploring MJ style codes, animating images, or debugging why a prompt isn't producing the intended result.
