# Planning Workflow

## Overview

planning-workflow orchestrates complete planning from requirements through tasks to tracking setup.

**Component Skills** (3):
1. **planning-architect** - Architecture and structure planning
2. **task-development** - Task breakdown with estimates
3. **todo-management** - Setup progress tracking

**Workflow** (3 steps):
1. **Plan Architecture** - Create comprehensive skill plan
2. **Break Down Tasks** - Convert plan into concrete tasks
3. **Setup Tracking** - Initialize todo list for execution

**Result**: Complete planning artifacts ready for implementation

## When to Use

- Planning complex skills (need comprehensive planning)
- Large projects (detailed breakdown needed)
- Team projects (clear task assignment)
- When thoroughness more important than speed

## Planning Workflow

### Step 1: Plan Architecture (planning-architect)

**Process**: Run planning-architect 6-step workflow
- Analyze requirements
- Choose pattern
- Design structure
- Plan content
- Estimate complexity
- Create plan document

**Output**: skill-architecture-plan.md

**Time**: 3-5 hours

---

### Step 2: Break Down Tasks (task-development)

**Process**: Run task-development 5-step workflow using plan from Step 1
- Analyze plan
- Identify components
- Break into tasks
- Sequence and dependencies
- Create task document

**Output**: task-breakdown.md

**Time**: 2-4 hours

---

### Step 3: Setup Tracking (todo-management)

**Process**: Use todo-management Operation 1 (Initialize)
- Create todo list from task breakdown
- Set initial states (all pending)
- Ready for execution

**Output**: todo-list.md (ready to track)

**Time**: 15-30 minutes

---

## Post-Workflow: Begin Implementation

With complete planning artifacts:
- Architecture plan guides what to build
- Task breakdown guides how to sequence
- Todo list tracks progress

**Next**: Execute implementation following plan and tasks

## Quick Reference

### The 3-Step Planning Workflow

| Step | Skill | Time | Output |
|------|-------|------|--------|
| 1 | planning-architect | 3-5h | skill-architecture-plan.md |
| 2 | task-development | 2-4h | task-breakdown.md |
| 3 | todo-management | 15-30m | todo-list.md |

**Total Time**: 5.5-9.5 hours

**When to Use**: Complex skills needing thorough planning

**Alternative**: For simple skills, use planning-architect only (skip task-development)

**planning-workflow provides complete planning from requirements to ready-to-execute task list.**
