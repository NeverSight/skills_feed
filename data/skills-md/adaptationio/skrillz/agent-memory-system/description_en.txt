Persistent memory architecture for AI agents across sessions. Episodic memory (past events), procedural memory (learned skills), semantic memory (knowledge graph), short-term memory (active context). Use when implementing cross-session persistence, skill learning, context preservation, personalization, or building truly adaptive AI systems with long-term memory.
