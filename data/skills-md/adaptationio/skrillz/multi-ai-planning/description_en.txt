Create production-ready, agent-executable plans using verification-first approach, hierarchical decomposition, dependency mapping, and quality gates. Optional multi-AI research integration (Claude + Gemini + Codex). Use when planning complex features, migrations, refactorings, security implementations, or any multi-step agentic workflows requiring rigorous verification and parallel execution coordination.
