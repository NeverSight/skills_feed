Initialize or improve AGENTS.md files that define how coding agents operate in a repo. Use when asked to set up or replace an agent init command (Codex, Claude), standardize multi-agent behavior, or audit an existing AGENTS.md for clarity, commands, boundaries, and repo-specific context. For Claude Code, also create CLAUDE.md as a symlink to AGENTS.md.
