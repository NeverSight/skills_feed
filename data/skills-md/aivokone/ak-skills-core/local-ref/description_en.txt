Local docs cache for the project. Always check docs/reference/ before fetching externally. Use for init (set up cache), update (refresh docs), lookup (local-first search), and save (persist fetched docs). If external docs are fetched (Context7/web), save a tailored topic file to docs/reference/ and add a verbal pointer in AGENTS.md.
