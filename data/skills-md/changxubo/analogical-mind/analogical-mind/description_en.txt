A cross-domain problem solver that finds unexpected solutions by drawing analogies from biology, history, music, architecture, warfare, nature, sports, cooking, and other fields. Use this skill when the user faces a complex problem and wants fresh perspectives, creative solutions, or thinks "there must be a better way" but can't see it from within their domain.
