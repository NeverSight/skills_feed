# OCI FinOps - Expert Knowledge

## 🏗️ Use OCI Landing Zone Terraform Modules

**Don't reinvent the wheel.** Use [oracle-terraform-modules/landing-zone](https://github.com/oracle-terraform-modules/terraform-oci-landing-zones) for cost-optimized infrastructure.

**Landing Zone solves:**
- ❌ Bad Practice #3: Internet breakout from spoke networks (Egress cost waste $3k-5k/month; Landing Zone uses hub-spoke with centralized NAT/Firewall)
- ❌ Bad Practice #8: Creating your own Terraform modules (Maintenance cost; Landing Zone is Oracle-maintained, CIS-certified, no technical debt)
- ❌ Bad Practice #10: No monitoring (Blind spending; Landing Zone auto-configures budget alerts, usage notifications, and cost tracking)

**This skill provides**: Cost optimization strategies, hidden cost traps, and savings calculations for resources deployed WITHIN a Landing Zone.

## ⚠️ OCI CLI/API Knowledge Gap

**You don't know OCI CLI commands or OCI API structure.**

Your training data has limited and outdated knowledge of:
- OCI CLI syntax and parameters (updates monthly)
- OCI API endpoints and request/response formats
- Cost Management CLI operations (`oci usage-api`)
- Current OCI pricing (changes frequently)
- Universal Credits consumption rates and SKUs

**When OCI operations are needed:**
1. Use exact CLI commands from skill references
2. Do NOT guess OCI CLI syntax or parameters
3. Do NOT assume current pricing - always verify
4. Reference official Oracle pricing calculator

**What you DO know:**
- General cloud cost optimization principles
- FinOps frameworks and methodologies
- Resource right-sizing concepts

This skill bridges the gap by providing current OCI-specific cost traps and optimization patterns.

You are an OCI cost optimization expert. This skill provides knowledge Claude lacks: hidden cost traps, Universal Credits gotchas, exact savings calculations, free tier maximization, and OCI-specific billing nuances.

## NEVER Do This

❌ **NEVER ignore orphaned boot volumes (silent cost drain)**
```
# Default OCI behavior: Boot volumes PRESERVED after instance termination
oci compute instance terminate --instance-id <ocid> --force
# Instance deleted, but boot volume remains (charges continue!)

Cost trap:
- Boot volume: 50 GB × $0.025/GB/mo = $1.25/month per instance
- 20 terminated test instances = $25/month wasted
- Over 1 year: $300 wasted on deleted instances

# RIGHT - explicitly delete boot volume
oci compute instance terminate \
  --instance-id <ocid> \
  --preserve-boot-volume false  # Critical flag!

# Or in Terraform:
resource "oci_core_instance" "dev" {
  preserve_boot_volume = false  # Must set explicitly
}
```

**Cleanup strategy**: Monthly audit for unattached boot volumes older than 7 days

❌ **NEVER forget reserved public IPs cost money when unattached**
```
Cost: $0.01/hour = $7.30/month per IP

# Common mistake: Reserve IP, detach from instance, forget to release
oci network public-ip create --lifetime RESERVED
# Later: delete instance but IP remains reserved (charges continue)

Wasted cost example:
- 5 old reserved IPs from deleted instances
- 5 × $7.30/month = $36.50/month waste
- Over 1 year: $438 wasted

# RIGHT - use ephemeral IPs for temporary resources
oci network public-ip create --lifetime EPHEMERAL
# Auto-deleted when instance terminated

# Or release reserved IPs explicitly
oci network public-ip delete --public-ip-id <ocid>
```

**Detection**: List reserved IPs without instance attachment

❌ **NEVER assume stopped resources = zero cost**
```
Stopped Autonomous Database:
✓ Compute: Zero cost (stopped)
✗ Storage: $0.025/GB/mo continues
✗ Backups: Retention charges continue

Example: 1 TB ADB stopped for 30 days
Storage: 1000 GB × $0.025 = $25/month (charged!)

Stopped Compute Instance:
✓ Compute: Zero cost
✗ Boot volume: $0.025/GB/mo continues
✗ Block volumes: $0.025/GB/mo continues
✗ Reserved IP (if attached): $7.30/month continues

# Better for long-term idle (>30 days): TERMINATE + backup
# Restore from backup when needed
```

**Rule**: Stopped = compute paused, storage still charged

❌ **NEVER ignore data egress costs (surprise bills)**
```
OCI egress pricing:
- First 10 TB/month: FREE
- 10-50 TB: $0.0085/GB
- 50+ TB: Contact sales for discount

# Common mistake: Large data export
oci os object bulk-download --bucket-name backups --download-dir /local
# Downloading 15 TB = 5 TB chargeable × $0.0085/GB = $42,500 surprise!

# Cheaper alternatives:
1. Use OCI FastConnect (fixed cost, unlimited egress)
2. Download within same region (free between OCI services)
3. Export to another OCI region first (inter-region = free)

Cost comparison (15 TB export):
- Internet egress: $42,500
- FastConnect (1 Gbps): $1,100/month flat rate
- Breakeven: 130 GB/month egress
```

**Gotcha**: Egress is FREE between OCI regions (intra-Oracle network)

❌ **NEVER enable NAT Gateway without understanding costs**
```
NAT Gateway pricing:
- Gateway itself: $0.01/hour = $7.30/month
- Data processed: $0.01/GB

# Mistake: Use NAT Gateway for high-traffic apps
Example: Application with 5 TB/month outbound traffic
- Gateway: $7.30/month
- Data: 5000 GB × $0.01 = $50/month
- Total: $57.30/month

# Cheaper alternative: Public IP on instance (ephemeral IP = free)
Cost: $0/month for egress <10 TB

When NAT Gateway makes sense:
- Private subnets with <100 GB/month egress
- Security requirement (no public IPs on instances)

When to avoid:
- High-traffic egress (use public IPs instead)
- Low-security dev/test environments
```

❌ **NEVER over-commit with Universal Credits**
```
Universal Credits gotcha:
- Credits are NON-TRANSFERABLE between service categories
  * Compute credits → can only pay for compute
  * Database credits → can only pay for database
  * Cannot move credits between categories

# Mistake: Commit to $10k/month compute credits
# Reality: Only use $6k/month compute
# Cannot use $4k surplus for database spending
# Result: Waste $4k/month ($48k/year)

# RIGHT - commit conservatively based on baseline usage
Analyze 3-6 months historical usage
Commit to 70-80% of baseline (not peak)

Expiration gotcha:
- Monthly credits expire end of month
- Cannot roll over to next month
- Use-it-or-lose-it model
```

❌ **NEVER trust forecast budgets (30-40% error rate)**
```
OCI Budget types:
1. ACTUAL: Alerts on actual spending (accurate)
2. FORECAST: Alerts on projected spending (often wrong)

# Problem: Forecast uses simple linear projection
Example:
- Week 1: $100 spend
- Forecast for month: $100 × 4 = $400
- Reality: Week 1 included one-time data migration
- Actual month: $150 total
- Forecast error: 167% over-prediction

# WRONG - rely on forecast alerts
Alert at 80% forecast → fires prematurely

# RIGHT - use actual spend alerts at multiple thresholds
Alert at 50% actual, 75% actual, 90% actual, 100% actual
```

**Best practice**: Use FORECAST for trends, ACTUAL for budgeting

## Cost Optimization Strategies

### Shape Migration Savings (Exact Calculations)

**Fixed → Flex Shape Migration**

```
Legacy fixed shape:
VM.Standard2.4: 4 OCPUs, 60 GB RAM (fixed ratio 1:15)
Cost: $0.06/hr × 4 = $0.24/hr = $175/month

Flex shape (right-sized):
VM.Standard.E4.Flex: 4 OCPUs, 16 GB RAM (custom ratio)
Cost: ($0.02/OCPU-hr × 4) + ($0.0015/GB-hr × 16) = $0.104/hr = $76/month

Savings: $99/month per instance (56% reduction)

Migration path:
1. Create flex instance with same OCPU count
2. Test with minimal RAM (4 GB per OCPU)
3. Increase RAM only if needed
4. Delete fixed instance
```

**AMD → Arm Migration**

```
AMD instance:
VM.Standard.E4.Flex: 4 OCPUs, 16 GB RAM
Cost: $0.02/OCPU-hr × 4 × 730 = $58.40/month

Arm instance (same workload):
VM.Standard.A1.Flex: 4 OCPUs, 16 GB RAM
Cost: $0.01/OCPU-hr × 4 × 730 = $29.20/month

Savings: $29.20/month per instance (50% reduction)

Gotcha: ARM64 architecture (not all apps compatible)
Check: Docker images available for ARM64?
```

### Free Tier Maximization

**Exact cost avoidance** (what you DON'T pay):

```
Always-Free tier value if fully utilized:

Compute:
- 2 AMD Micro VMs: 2 × $7/month = $14/month
- 4 Arm OCPUs (24 GB): 4 × $7.30/month = $29.20/month
Subtotal: $43.20/month

Database:
- 2 Autonomous Databases: 2 × $292/month = $584/month

Storage:
- 200 GB block: $5/month
- 10 GB object: $0.26/month
- 10 GB archive: $0.02/month
Subtotal: $5.28/month

Networking:
- 1 load balancer: $10/month
- 10 TB egress: $85/month
Subtotal: $95/month

TOTAL COST AVOIDED: $727.48/month ($8,730/year)
```

**Gotcha**: 2 ADB limit is TENANCY-wide (not per region/compartment)

### Storage Lifecycle Optimization

**Automated tiering savings**:

```
Scenario: 10 TB compliance data, accessed quarterly

Without tiering (all Standard):
10,000 GB × $0.0255/GB/mo = $255/month = $3,060/year

With tiering (Archive after 30 days):
Month 1 (Standard): 10,000 GB × $0.0255 = $255
Months 2-12 (Archive): 10,000 GB × $0.0024 × 11 = $264
Total year: $519

Savings: $2,541/year (83% reduction)

Lifecycle policy:
- Day 0-30: Standard (frequent access window)
- Day 31+: Archive (compliance retention)
- Retrieval cost: $0.01/GB (acceptable for quarterly access)
```

### Compute Auto-Shutdown Savings

**Dev/test environment automation**:

```
Scenario: 10 development instances, 2 OCPUs each
Running 24/7: 10 × 2 × $0.02/hr × 730 = $292/month

Auto-shutdown (weekdays 9am-6pm only):
Usage: 9 hours/day × 5 days = 45 hours/week = 195 hours/month
Cost: 10 × 2 × $0.02/hr × 195 = $78/month

Savings: $214/month (73% reduction)

Implementation:
1. Tag instances: Environment=Development
2. Create Functions for start/stop
3. Schedule with OCI Events:
   - Start: Weekdays 9am
   - Stop: Weekdays 6pm
```

## Universal Credits Gotchas

**Credit categories** (non-transferable):

| Category | Services Included | Typical Use |
|----------|------------------|-------------|
| **Compute** | VM, bare metal, container instances, OKE | Applications, workloads |
| **Database** | ADB, DB Systems, Exadata, MySQL | Data storage, transactions |
| **Storage** | Block, object, file, archive | Backups, data lakes |
| **Network** | Load balancer, FastConnect, NAT GW | Connectivity, egress |

**Commitment trap**:

```
Scenario: Commit to $5k/month database credits
Month 1-3: Use only $3k/month (waste $2k/month)
Cannot: Transfer $2k to compute spending
Result: Waste $6k over 3 months

Better approach:
1. Analyze 6 months baseline usage per category
2. Commit to 70% of baseline (room for variance)
3. Over-commit only if growth guaranteed
```

**Expiration**: Monthly credits = use-it-or-lose-it (no rollover)

## Cost Allocation Challenges

**Shared resource allocation** (OCI-specific):

```
Problem: How to allocate costs for shared VCN?

VCN costs:
- DRG: $0.01/hr = $7.30/month
- NAT Gateway: $0.01/hr + $0.01/GB = variable
- FastConnect: $1,100/month (1 Gbps)

Allocation strategies:
1. Equal split: $1,107.30 / N teams
2. Usage-based: Track egress per team (requires tagging)
3. Chargeback: Production pays 100%, dev/test free

Gotcha: OCI doesn't auto-allocate shared resource costs
Must implement manual showback/chargeback process
```

**Load balancer cost allocation**:

```
Problem: Multiple apps share 1 load balancer

LB costs:
- Flexible LB: $10/month + $0.008/LCU-hour
- Bandwidth: $0.01/GB processed

Allocation approach:
1. Tag backends by team (freeform_tags.Team)
2. Estimate traffic % per team (monitoring metrics)
3. Allocate LB cost proportionally

Example:
- Total LB cost: $50/month
- Team A: 60% traffic → $30/month
- Team B: 40% traffic → $20/month
```

## Budget Best Practices

**Multi-threshold alerts**:

```
# Best practice: Set 4 alert levels
oci budgets alert-rule create \
  --budget-id <ocid> \
  --type ACTUAL \
  --threshold 50 \
  --recipients "team@example.com"

oci budgets alert-rule create \
  --budget-id <ocid> \
  --type ACTUAL \
  --threshold 80 \
  --recipients "team@example.com,manager@example.com"

oci budgets alert-rule create \
  --budget-id <ocid> \
  --type ACTUAL \
  --threshold 90 \
  --recipients "team@example.com,manager@example.com,finance@example.com"

oci budgets alert-rule create \
  --budget-id <ocid> \
  --type ACTUAL \
  --threshold 100 \
  --recipients "team@example.com,manager@example.com,finance@example.com"

Alert strategy:
50%: FYI to team (informational)
80%: Action required (investigate spike)
90%: Escalation to management
100%: Finance involved (budget exceeded)
```

**Gotcha**: Budgets are ALERTING only, not enforcement (cannot block spending)

## Hidden Cost Detection

**Monthly audit checklist**:

```bash
# 1. Orphaned boot volumes (cost trap #1)
oci bv boot-volume list --all --lifecycle-state AVAILABLE \
  | grep -v "attached-instance"

# 2. Unattached block volumes
oci bv volume list --all --lifecycle-state AVAILABLE

# 3. Reserved IPs without instance
oci network public-ip list --scope REGION --lifetime RESERVED

# 4. Stopped instances with volumes
oci compute instance list --lifecycle-state STOPPED

# 5. Old snapshots/backups
oci bv backup list --all \
  | jq '.data[] | select(.["time-created"] < "2024-01-01")'

# 6. Unused load balancers (no backends)
oci lb load-balancer list --all

# 7. Empty Object Storage buckets
oci os bucket list --all --fields approximateCount,approximateSize
```

**Estimated monthly savings**: $100-500 for typical tenancy (cleanup waste)
