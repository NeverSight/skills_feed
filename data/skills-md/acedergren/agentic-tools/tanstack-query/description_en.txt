TanStack Query v5 expert guidance - migration gotchas (v4→v5 breaking changes),
performance pitfalls (infinite refetch loops, staleness traps), and decision
frameworks (when NOT to use queries, SWR vs React Query trade-offs).

Use when: (1) debugging v4→v5 migration errors (gcTime, isPending, throwOnError),
(2) infinite refetch loops, (3) SSR hydration mismatches, (4) choosing between
React Query vs SWR vs fetch, (5) optimistic update patterns not working.

NOT for basic setup (see official docs). Focuses on non-obvious decisions and
patterns that cause production issues.

Triggers: React Query, TanStack Query, v5 migration, refetch loop, stale data,
SSR hydration, query invalidation, optimistic updates debugging.
