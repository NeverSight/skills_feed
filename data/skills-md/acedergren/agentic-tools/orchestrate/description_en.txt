Coordinate parallel agent teams to execute multi-task implementation plans. Use when running phase tasks from the task plan, parallelizing independent implementation work, or executing custom plan files. Supports interactive (in-session TeamCreate agents) and headless (claude -p fire-and-forget processes) execution modes with task ledger tracking, heartbeat monitoring, budget control, and wave-based quality gates.
