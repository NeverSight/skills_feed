Detect and fix AI writing patterns including overused phrases (testament to, pivotal,
landscape, delve), structural tells (rule of three, em dash overuse, negative parallelisms,
copula avoidance), promotional language, and vague attributions. Use when user asks to
"make text sound human", "remove AI tells", "humanize writing", mentions patterns like
"too many dashes" or "sounds like ChatGPT", or requests natural/conversational tone.

Triggers: AI-generated, humanize, writing style, natural writing, human voice, ChatGPT
sound, remove AI patterns, conversational tone, writing voice.
