Create a concise plan for coding/build tasks, especially when users say "I want to make..." or "I need to do...". Use to generate a final plan by aggregating multiple subagent plan variants, include ASCII diagrams/flows/UI mockups when possible, and follow the create-plan style (read-only scan, minimal questions).
