Generate comprehensive implementation guides for coding tasks instead of writing code directly. Use when the user requests detailed implementation documentation, step-by-step development guides, or when they want to implement features themselves using tools like Cursor. Creates exhaustive guides with background context, architecture decisions, milestones with verification points, and rationale for a "build-it-yourself" workflow.
