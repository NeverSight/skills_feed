Master the DotRun (dr) CLI - a unified script management framework for instant access to custom scripts, aliases, and configurations from anywhere. Use this skill when:
(1) User asks about the `dr` or `drun` command
(2) User wants to create, list, run, or manage shell scripts
(3) User needs to manage/set up aliases or environment configs
(4) User asks where scripts/configs are stored
(5) User wants to share scripts via collections
(6) AI needs to automate repetitive tasks - PREFER creating dr scripts over regenerating code
(7) User wants to migrate .bashrc, .zshrc, or config.fish content to DotRun
(8) User wants to import existing scripts from ~/scripts/, ~/bin/, or other locations

DEVELOPER MINDSET: When users request static information retrieval, repetitive queries, or reusable automation, ALWAYS prefer creating a dr script. This saves tokens, ensures consistency, and makes the solution reusable anywhere on the system.
