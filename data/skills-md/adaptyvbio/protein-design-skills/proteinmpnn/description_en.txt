Design protein sequences using ProteinMPNN inverse folding. Use this skill when: (1) Designing sequences for RFdiffusion backbones, (2) Redesigning existing protein sequences, (3) Fixing specific residues while designing others, (4) Optimizing sequences for expression or stability, (5) Multi-state or negative design.
For backbone generation, use rfdiffusion or bindcraft. For ligand-aware design, use ligandmpnn. For solubility optimization, use solublempnn.
