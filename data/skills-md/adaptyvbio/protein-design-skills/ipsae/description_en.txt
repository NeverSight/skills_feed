Binder design ranking using ipSAE (interprotein Score from Aligned Errors). Use this skill when: (1) Ranking binder designs for experimental testing, (2) Filtering BindCraft or RFdiffusion outputs, (3) Comparing AF2/AF3/Boltz predictions, (4) Predicting binding success rates, (5) Need better ranking than ipTM or iPAE.
For structure prediction, use chai or alphafold. For QC thresholds, use protein-qc.
