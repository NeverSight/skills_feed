Access UniProt for protein sequence and annotation retrieval. Use this skill when: (1) Looking up protein sequences by accession, (2) Finding functional annotations, (3) Getting domain boundaries, (4) Finding homologs and variants, (5) Cross-referencing to PDB structures.
For structure retrieval, use pdb. For sequence design, use proteinmpnn.
