Quality control metrics and filtering thresholds for protein design. Use this skill when: (1) Evaluating design quality for binding, expression, or structure, (2) Setting filtering thresholds for pLDDT, ipTM, PAE, (3) Checking sequence liabilities (cysteines, deamidation, polybasic clusters), (4) Creating multi-stage filtering pipelines, (5) Computing PyRosetta interface metrics (dG, SC, dSASA), (6) Checking biophysical properties (instability, GRAVY, pI), (7) Ranking designs with composite scoring.
This skill provides research-backed thresholds from binder design competitions and published benchmarks.
