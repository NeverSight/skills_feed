Solubility-optimized protein sequence design using SolubleMPNN. Use this skill when: (1) Designing for E. coli expression, (2) Optimizing solubility of designed proteins, (3) Reducing aggregation propensity, (4) Need high-yield expression, (5) Avoiding inclusion body formation.
For standard design, use proteinmpnn. For ligand-aware design, use ligandmpnn.
