Structure similarity search with Foldseek. Use this skill when: (1) Finding similar structures in PDB/AFDB databases, (2) Structural homology search, (3) Database queries by 3D structure, (4) Finding remote homologs not detected by sequence, (5) Clustering structures by similarity.
For sequence similarity, use uniprot BLAST. For structure prediction, use chai or boltz.
