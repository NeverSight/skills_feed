All-atom protein design using BoltzGen diffusion model. Use this skill when: (1) Need side-chain aware design from the start, (2) Designing around small molecules or ligands, (3) Want all-atom diffusion (not just backbone), (4) Require precise binding geometries, (5) Using YAML-based configuration.
For backbone-only generation, use rfdiffusion. For sequence-only design, use proteinmpnn. For structure validation, use boltz.
