ESM2 protein language model for embeddings and sequence scoring. Use this skill when: (1) Computing pseudo-log-likelihood (PLL) scores, (2) Getting protein embeddings for clustering, (3) Filtering designs by sequence plausibility, (4) Zero-shot variant effect prediction, (5) Analyzing sequence-function relationships.
For structure prediction, use chai or boltz. For QC thresholds, use protein-qc.
