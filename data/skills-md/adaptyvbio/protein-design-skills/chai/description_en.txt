Structure prediction using Chai-1, a foundation model for molecular structure. Use this skill when: (1) Predicting protein-protein complex structures, (2) Validating designed binders, (3) Predicting protein-ligand complexes, (4) Using the Chai API for high-throughput prediction, (5) Need an alternative to AlphaFold2.
For QC thresholds, use protein-qc. For AlphaFold2 prediction, use alphafold. For ESM-based analysis, use esm.
