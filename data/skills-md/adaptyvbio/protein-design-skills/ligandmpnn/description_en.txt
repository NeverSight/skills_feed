Ligand-aware protein sequence design using LigandMPNN. Use this skill when: (1) Designing sequences around small molecules, (2) Enzyme active site design, (3) Ligand binding pocket optimization, (4) Metal coordination site design, (5) Cofactor binding proteins.
For standard protein design, use proteinmpnn. For solubility optimization, use solublempnn.
