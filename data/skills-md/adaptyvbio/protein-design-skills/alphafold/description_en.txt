Validate protein designs using AlphaFold2 structure prediction. Use this skill when: (1) Validating designed sequences fold correctly, (2) Predicting binder-target complex structures, (3) Calculating confidence metrics (pLDDT, pTM, ipTM), (4) Self-consistency validation of designs, (5) Multi-chain complex prediction with AlphaFold-Multimer.
For faster single-chain prediction, use esm. For QC thresholds, use protein-qc.
