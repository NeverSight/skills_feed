Build and search knowledge bases from documents using the Denser Retriever API. No-code RAG pipeline - upload PDFs, DOCX, PPTX, and other files, then search them with semantic search through natural conversation. Use this skill for: knowledge base creation, document upload, semantic search, document retrieval, PDF search, file indexing, RAG (retrieval-augmented generation), vector search, AI search, question answering over documents, text search API, document Q&A, knowledge management, and enterprise search. Trigger on: 'knowledge base', 'semantic search', 'document search', 'RAG', 'search my files', 'upload documents', 'PDF search', 'denser retriever', 'index documents', 'search knowledge base', 'document retrieval', 'vector search', or any request to search, query, or build a searchable collection of files.
