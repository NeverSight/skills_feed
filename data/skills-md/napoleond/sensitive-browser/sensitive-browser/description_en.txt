Execute sensitive browser actions (login, payments, form filling) outside the core agent loop using a dedicated CLI tool. Use when Claude needs to handle credentials, payment information, or other sensitive data in browser automation workflows. Triggers when users ask to log into websites, fill payment forms, or perform authenticated browser actions where sensitive data must be kept secure and separate from the main agent context.
