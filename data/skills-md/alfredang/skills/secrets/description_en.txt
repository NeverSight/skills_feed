Enforce secure secrets management across all platforms. Never hardcode OAuth2 secrets, API keys, tokens, passwords, or credentials in source code. Store all secrets in .env files, load from environment variables, and ensure .env is gitignored. Use this skill when: (1) writing any code that uses API keys, OAuth2 client secrets, tokens, or credentials, (2) setting up authentication or third-party integrations, (3) creating new projects that need environment configuration, (4) reviewing code for security issues related to secrets, (5) configuring CI/CD pipelines or Docker deployments with secrets. Triggers: API key, OAuth, client secret, token, credentials, .env, environment variables, secret, password, authentication setup, third-party integration.
