Auto-update GitHub repo description, live site URL, and topics. Analyzes your codebase to generate a compelling description, detects deployment URLs, and adds relevant topics. Use when setting up a repo, after deploying, or to polish your GitHub presence. Use when the user says "update github about", "update repo about", "set repo description", "add topics", "update about section", "github about", or any reference to updating a GitHub repository's about/description/topics/homepage.
