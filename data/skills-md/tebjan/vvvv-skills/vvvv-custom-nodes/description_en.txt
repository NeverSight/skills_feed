Helps write C# node classes for vvvv gamma — the [ProcessNode] pattern, Update() method, out parameters, pin configuration, change detection, stateless operation nodes, and service consumption via NodeContext (IFrameClock, Game access, logging). Use when writing a node class, adding pins, implementing change detection, accessing services in node constructors, or creating stateless utility methods. Requires [assembly: ImportAsIs].
