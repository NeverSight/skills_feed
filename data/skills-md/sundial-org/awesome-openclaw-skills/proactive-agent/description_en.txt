Transform AI agents from task-followers into proactive partners that anticipate needs and continuously improve. Includes memory architecture with pre-compaction flush (so context survives when the window fills), reverse prompting (surfaces ideas you didn't know to ask for), security hardening, self-healing patterns (diagnoses and fixes its own issues), and alignment systems (stays on mission, remembers who it serves). Battle-tested patterns for agents that learn from every interaction and create value without being asked.
