RSS news aggregator. Fetches headlines from curated feeds across three categories: news, games, and finance. Use when the user asks about current news, headlines, what's happening, what's going on, or says "what's up in news", "what's up in finance", "what's up in games", or the German equivalents "was geht mit nachrichten", "was geht mit money", "was geht mit gaming". Also activates for requests like "give me a news rundown", "latest headlines", "market news", "gaming news", "tech news", "finance roundup", or "briefing". Returns structured JSON from public RSS feeds — no API keys, no web search needed.
