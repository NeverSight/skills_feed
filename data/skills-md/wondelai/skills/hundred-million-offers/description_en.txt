Grand Slam Offer creation framework based on Alex Hormozi's "$100M Offers". Use when you need to: (1) create irresistible offers using the Value Equation, (2) design Grand Slam Offers with bonuses, guarantees, and scarcity, (3) find your starving crowd and ideal market, (4) implement value-based pricing with 10:1 value-to-price ratio, (5) stack bonuses that increase perceived value, (6) design risk-reversing guarantees, (7) apply ethical scarcity and urgency, (8) name offers using the MAGIC formula.
