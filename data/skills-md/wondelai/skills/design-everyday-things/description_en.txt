Fundamental design principles based on Don Norman's "The Design of Everyday Things". Use when you need to: (1) design affordances and signifiers into interfaces, (2) analyze why products are confusing, (3) apply constraints to prevent errors, (4) design clear feedback mechanisms, (5) bridge gulfs of execution and evaluation, (6) create intuitive conceptual models, (7) apply human-centered design, (8) understand why users make errors and design fault-tolerant systems.
