Sticky messaging framework based on Chip & Dan Heath's "Made to Stick". Use when you need to: (1) make product messaging more memorable, (2) write sticky taglines and value propositions, (3) create compelling product demos and presentations, (4) design memorable onboarding experiences, (5) craft internal communications that stick, (6) apply the SUCCESs framework (Simple, Unexpected, Concrete, Credible, Emotional, Stories), (7) analyze why messaging isn't resonating.
