Outbound sales methodology based on Aaron Ross' "Predictable Revenue". Use when you need to: (1) build a scalable outbound sales process, (2) implement Cold Calling 2.0, (3) structure sales team roles (SDR/AE/CSM), (4) design lead generation and qualification frameworks, (5) scale B2B SaaS sales predictably, (6) create prospecting email sequences, (7) build sales development pipeline, (8) separate prospecting from closing.
