Strategic framework for discovering and designing product innovations based on Clayton Christensen's Jobs to Be Done (JTBD) theory from "Competing Against Luck". Use when you need to: (1) understand customers' true motivations, (2) design a new product or feature, (3) conduct customer discovery interviews, (4) analyze competition through the "jobs" lens, (5) diagnose why a product isn't selling or customers are churning, (6) create positioning strategy, (7) build a jobs-oriented organization.
