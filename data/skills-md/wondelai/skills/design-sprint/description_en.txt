Design Sprint methodology based on Jake Knapp's "Sprint" (Google Ventures). Use when you need to: (1) validate product ideas in 5 days instead of months, (2) rapidly prototype and test solutions, (3) answer critical business questions quickly, (4) align teams on product direction, (5) de-risk product development before building, (6) test multiple concepts with real users, (7) make fast strategic decisions through structured process.
