Technology adoption and go-to-market strategy based on Geoffrey Moore's "Crossing the Chasm". Use when you need to: (1) identify where your product is in the adoption lifecycle, (2) choose a beachhead market segment, (3) build a "whole product" solution for mainstream buyers, (4) position against incumbent competition, (5) transition from early adopters to mainstream market, (6) develop B2B tech marketing strategy, (7) understand why tech products fail to gain mainstream traction.
