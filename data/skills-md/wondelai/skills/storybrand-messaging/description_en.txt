StoryBrand messaging framework based on Donald Miller's "Building a StoryBrand". Use when you need to: (1) clarify your brand message so customers understand it, (2) create website copy that converts, (3) write one-liners and elevator pitches, (4) build landing pages that follow narrative structure, (5) create marketing collateral that positions customer as hero, (6) diagnose why messaging isn't resonating, (7) develop a brand script for consistent communication.
