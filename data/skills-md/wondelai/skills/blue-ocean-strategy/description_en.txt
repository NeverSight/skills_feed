Blue Ocean Strategy framework based on W. Chan Kim & Renée Mauborgne's book. Use when you need to: (1) create uncontested market space instead of competing head-to-head, (2) analyze competitive landscape (red vs. blue oceans), (3) design value innovation propositions, (4) use Strategy Canvas and Four Actions Framework (ERRC), (5) identify non-customers and convert them, (6) break the value-cost trade-off, (7) shift from competition to value innovation.
