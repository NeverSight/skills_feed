Motivation science framework based on Daniel Pink's "Drive". Use when you need to: (1) design features that leverage intrinsic motivation, (2) create progress systems that support mastery, (3) craft purpose-driven messaging and missions, (4) audit if product mechanics undermine autonomy, (5) design team structures and incentives with AMP principles (Autonomy, Mastery, Purpose), (6) understand why gamification fails, (7) replace carrot-and-stick approaches with intrinsic motivation.
