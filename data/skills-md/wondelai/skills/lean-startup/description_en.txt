Lean Startup methodology based on Eric Ries' "The Lean Startup". Use when you need to: (1) design MVP scope for new product ideas, (2) define validated learning experiments, (3) create innovation accounting frameworks, (4) decide when to pivot vs. persevere, (5) set up metrics that matter vs. vanity metrics, (6) reduce product development waste, (7) apply scientific method to entrepreneurship, (8) test business model assumptions quickly.
