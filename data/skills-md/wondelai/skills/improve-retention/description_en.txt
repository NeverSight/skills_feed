Behavior design framework based on BJ Fogg's "Tiny Habits". Use when you need to: (1) diagnose why users aren't completing key actions, (2) reduce friction using the Ability Chain, (3) design effective prompts, (4) create tiny behaviors that compound into retention, (5) audit motivation-ability mismatches, (6) design onboarding that builds lasting habits, (7) apply B=MAP to improve activation and retention metrics.
