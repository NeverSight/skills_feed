This skill retrieves upcoming earnings announcements for US stocks using the Financial Modeling Prep (FMP) API. Use this when the user requests earnings calendar data, wants to know which companies are reporting earnings in the upcoming week, or needs a weekly earnings review. The skill focuses on mid-cap and above companies (over $2B market cap) that have significant market impact, organizing the data by date and timing in a clean markdown table format. Supports multiple environments (CLI, Desktop, Web) with flexible API key management.
