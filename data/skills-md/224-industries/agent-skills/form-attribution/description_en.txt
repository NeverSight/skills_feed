Implement the Form Attribution library on websites to capture UTM parameters, ad click IDs, referrer data, and other marketing attribution automatically. Use when the user needs to (1) add marketing attribution tracking to a website, (2) configure form attribution for specific use cases like cross-subdomain tracking or CRM integration, (3) troubleshoot form attribution issues, or (4) implement platform-specific patterns for Webflow, HubSpot, WordPress, or other select platforms.
