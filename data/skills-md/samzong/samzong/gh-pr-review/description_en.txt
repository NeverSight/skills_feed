Review a GitHub Pull Request as a responsible project owner using the `gh` CLI. Use when the user provides a PR URL (e.g. https://github.com/ORG/REPO/pull/N) or a PR number for the current git repo (prefer upstream, else origin) and wants an owner-grade review document `review-N.md` written in Chinese with copy-pastable GitHub comments in English. Scope the review to lines changed by the PR (do not nitpick unrelated pre-existing code), but apply best practices and flag any clear bugs, security issues, or CI failures caused by the change.
