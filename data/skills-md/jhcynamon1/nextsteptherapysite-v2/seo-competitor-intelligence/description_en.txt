Reverse-engineer top-ranking competitor pages to identify content gaps and create "beat the competition" briefs. Analyzes content structure, schema markup, E-E-A-T signals, local SEO, and generates actionable outlines. Use when user mentions "competitor analysis", provides competitor URLs, asks "why am I not ranking", or requests content gap analysis for therapy/healthcare keywords.
