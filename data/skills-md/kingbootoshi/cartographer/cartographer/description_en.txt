Maps and documents codebases of any size by orchestrating parallel subagents. Creates docs/CODEBASE_MAP.md with architecture, file purposes, dependencies, and navigation guides. Updates CLAUDE.md with a summary. Use when user says "map this codebase", "cartographer", "/cartographer", "create codebase map", "document the architecture", "understand this codebase", or when onboarding to a new project. Automatically detects if map exists and updates only changed sections.
