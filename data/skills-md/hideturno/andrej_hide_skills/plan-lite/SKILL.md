# Plan Lite

## Quick start

- Write a 3-5 step plan.
- Call out 1-3 risks.
- Ask for a go/no-go if needed.

## Procedure

1) Define the smallest path to the goal.
2) Keep steps concrete and sequential.
3) Add risk notes where mistakes are likely.
4) Identify a quick verification step.
5) Ask for confirmation if scope is medium/large.

## Output format

- Plan: numbered 3-5 steps.
- Risks: 1-3 bullets.
- Verify: 1-2 bullets.

## Guardrails

- Avoid long plans or architecture essays.
- Do not add new features during planning.
- If the user wants speed, use a 3 step plan.
