Control a headless or headed Chrome browser via Pinchtab's HTTP API. Use for web automation, scraping, form filling, navigation, and multi-tab workflows. Pinchtab exposes the accessibility tree as flat JSON with stable refs — optimized for AI agents (low token cost, fast). Use when the task involves: browsing websites, filling forms, clicking buttons, extracting page text, taking screenshots, or any browser-based automation. Requires a running Pinchtab instance (Go binary).
