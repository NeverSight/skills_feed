Orchestrates end-to-end video generation through sequential workflow steps (audio, direction, assets, design, coding). Activates when user requests video creation from a script, wants to resume video generation, mentions "create video", "generate video", or "video workflow", requests running a specific step (audio, direction, assets, design, coding), asks to "create audio", "generate direction", "create assets", "generate design", or "code video components", or wants to resume a video. Manages workflow state tracking and parallel scene generation.
