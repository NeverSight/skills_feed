TypeScript patterns for low-level EVM blockchain interactions using Viem. Use when writing Node scripts, CLI tools, or backend services that read/write to Ethereum or EVM chains. Triggers on contract interactions, wallet operations, transaction signing, event watching, ABI encoding, or any non-React blockchain TypeScript code. Do NOT use for React/Next.js apps with hooks (use wagmi skill instead).
