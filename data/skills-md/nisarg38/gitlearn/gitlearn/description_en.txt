Auto-detects repo-specific patterns, architectural decisions, corrections, and conventions during development. Spawns a parallel agent to brutally verify and update both CLAUDE.md and AGENTS.md (kept in sync). Use when you notice patterns, get corrected, discover conventions, or learn something repo-specific.
