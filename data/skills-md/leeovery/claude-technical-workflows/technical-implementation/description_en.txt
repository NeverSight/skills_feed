Orchestrate implementation of plans using agent-based TDD workflow with per-task review and approval gate (auto mode available). Use when: (1) Implementing a plan from docs/workflow/planning/{topic}/plan.md, (2) User says 'implement', 'build', or 'code this' with a plan available, (3) Ad hoc coding that should follow TDD and quality standards, (4) Bug fixes or features benefiting from structured implementation. Dispatches executor and reviewer agents per task, commits after review approval.
