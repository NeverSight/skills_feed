IntelliJ-IDEA MCP provides powerful IDE features including running tests, code analysis, refactoring, search, and project navigation. Use this when you need accurate Java code analysis (avoiding LSP false positives), running tests via IDEA configurations, refactoring symbols, or exploring codebase structure. Key commands: execute_run_configuration (run tests), get_file_problems (accurate errors/warnings), search_in_files_by_text (search code), list_directory_tree (view structure), get_file_text_by_path (read files), rename_refactoring (safe refactoring), execute_terminal_command (run shell commands).
