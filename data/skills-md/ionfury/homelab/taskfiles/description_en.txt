Create, modify, and maintain Taskfiles following Task (https://taskfile.dev) best practices.

Use when: (1) Creating new tasks or Taskfiles, (2) Modifying existing task definitions,
(3) Adding new task includes, (4) Debugging task execution issues, (5) Questions about
Taskfile syntax or patterns, (6) Running or understanding "task" commands,
(7) Questions about available tasks or task namespaces.

Triggers: "taskfile", "Taskfile.yaml", "task command", "task:", "create task",
"add task", "task --list", "task tg:", "task inv:", "task wt:", ".taskfiles/",
"how to run", "available tasks", "task syntax", "taskfile.dev"

This skill covers the repository's specific conventions in .taskfiles/ and the root Taskfile.yaml.
