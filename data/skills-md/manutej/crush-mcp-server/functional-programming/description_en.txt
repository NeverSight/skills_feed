Master functional programming principles and patterns including purity, immutability, composition, higher-order functions, algebraic data types, functors, monads, and effect management. Use when working with functional paradigms, pure functions, immutable data structures, function composition, type-safe error handling, or implementing functional patterns like map/filter/reduce, currying, partial application, recursion, lazy evaluation, or referential transparency.
