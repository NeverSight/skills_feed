Master functional programming in TypeScript with type-safe patterns, strict typing, advanced type system features, discriminated unions, mapped types, conditional types, and functional patterns. Use when writing TypeScript code with functional paradigms, type-safe error handling with Option/Either types, implementing type-safe composition, leveraging TypeScript's type system for functional patterns, or ensuring compile-time safety in functional code.
