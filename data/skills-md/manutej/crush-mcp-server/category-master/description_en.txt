Expert-level category theory knowledge for rigorous mathematical reasoning. Use when working with categorical structures, functors, natural transformations, adjunctions, limits, toposes, monoidal categories, enriched categories, higher categories, operads, or any formal categorical construction. Ideal for proofs, diagram chases, universal properties, coherence conditions, and foundational mathematical abstractions.
