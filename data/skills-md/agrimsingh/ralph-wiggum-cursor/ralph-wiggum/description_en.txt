Implements the Ralph Wiggum autonomous iteration technique with deliberate context management. Use when building greenfield projects, iterating on well-defined tasks, or when continuous autonomous development is needed. Manages context like memory - tracks allocations, prevents redlining, and knows when to start fresh.
