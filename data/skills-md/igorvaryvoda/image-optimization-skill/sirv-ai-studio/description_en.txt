Guide for using Sirv AI Studio (www.sirv.studio), an AI-powered image and video processing platform. Use when working with product images, background removal, image upscaling, AI generation, video creation, batch processing, or e-commerce image workflows. Triggers on mentions of Sirv AI Studio, product photography, background removal, image upscaling, AI image generation, batch image processing, or marketplace optimization. IMPORTANT - If sirv-ai MCP tools are available (sirv_remove_background, sirv_upscale, sirv_generate, etc.), USE THEM directly for image processing tasks instead of telling user to visit the website.
