Use when investigating Kubernetes issues, analyzing alerts from Prometheus/AlertManager/PagerDuty, performing root cause analysis, configuring HolmesGPT installations (CLI/Helm/Docker), setting up AI providers (OpenAI/Anthropic/Azure), creating custom toolsets, or integrating with observability platforms (Grafana, Loki, Tempo, DataDog).
