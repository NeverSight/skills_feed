Real-time observability dashboard for multi-agent Claude Code sessions.

Visualize agent interactions, tool usage, and session flows in real-time through a web dashboard. Track multiple agents running in parallel with swim lane visualization, event filtering, and live charts.

**Key Features:**
- 🔴 Real-time event streaming via WebSocket
- 📊 Agent swim lanes showing parallel execution
- 🔍 Event filtering by agent, session, event type
- 📈 Live charts for tool usage patterns
- 💾 Filesystem-based (no database required)

**Inspired by [@indydevdan](https://github.com/indydevdan)**'s work on multi-agent observability.

**Our approach:** Filesystem + in-memory streaming vs. indydevdan's SQLite database approach.
