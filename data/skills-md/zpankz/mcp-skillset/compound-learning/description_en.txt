Self-improving holon implementing Plan→Execute→Assess→Compound workflow loops 
with explicit knowledge crystallization. Generalizes compound engineering beyond 
coding to any domain where work produces learnable signals: writing, research, 
learning, problem-solving, design. Use when: (1) task quality matters and can 
improve over time, (2) patterns emerge from repeated work, (3) institutional 
knowledge should accumulate, (4) future tasks should benefit from past learnings, 
(5) "compound", "learn from", "improve process", "capture learnings", or 
multi-step workflows with review cycles. Orchestrates parallel research agents, 
multi-lens assessment, and structured knowledge codification into searchable 
documentation with YAML frontmatter. Implements λο.τ → λ(ο,Κ).τ where Κ is 
accumulated knowledge that compounds interest-like over time.
