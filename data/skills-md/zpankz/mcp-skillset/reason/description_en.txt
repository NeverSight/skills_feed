Understand through recursive decomposition and modular reconstruction of simple operations to reproduce emergent complexity. Use this skill whenever reasoning is required. Framework for [[#parse|parsing]], [[#branch|branching]], [[#reduce|reducing]], [[#ground|grounding]] and [[#emit|emitting]]. Employs metacognitive reasoning epistemology, leveraging first principles through recursive decomposition[^1]. Self-referential and scale-invariant.
