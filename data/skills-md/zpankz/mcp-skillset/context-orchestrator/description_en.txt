Orchestrates context retrieval from three CLI sources: limitless (personal
life transcripts), research (online documentation/facts), pieces (local code/LTM).
Use when external context is needed beyond the current codebase. Triggers on
/context, /limitless, /research, /pieces, or balanced detection on complex prompts
involving personal memory, technical documentation, or development history.
