Teleological physiology analysis framework for understanding biological systems through multi-constraint optimization. Use when analyzing physiological mechanisms, explaining apparent biological "inefficiencies", preparing for medical examinations (CICM/ANZCA Primary), understanding why biological systems are designed the way they are, or when seeking deeper mechanistic understanding beyond descriptive knowledge. Triggers on questions like "why is X designed this way", "what purpose does Y serve", "how is Z optimized", analysis of physiological trade-offs, or exploration of evolutionary/design constraints.
