Maximally Endowed Graph Architecture — λ-calculus over bounded n-SuperHyperGraphs with grounded uncertainty, conditional self-duality, and autopoietic refinement. Use when (1) simple graphs insufficient (η<2), (2) multi-scale reasoning required, (3) uncertainty is structured not stochastic, (4) knowledge must self-refactor. Pareto-governed: complexity added only when simpler structures fail validation.
