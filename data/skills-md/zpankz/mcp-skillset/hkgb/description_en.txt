This skill should be used when building hybrid Knowledge Graphs that integrate structured data (CSV, databases) with automatically extracted entities from unstructured documents (PDFs, text). The pattern establishes a reliable join key between domain graphs and lexical graphs, enabling GraphRAG, document ingestion with metadata enrichment, and Knowledge Graph construction from heterogeneous sources using neo4j-graphrag SimpleKGPipeline.
