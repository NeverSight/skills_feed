Generates hierarchical knowledge graphs via Recursive Pareto Principle for optimised 
schema construction. Produces four-level structures (L0 meta-graph through L3 detail-graph) 
where each level contains 80% fewer nodes while grounding 80% of its derivative, achieving 
51% coverage from 0.8% of nodes via Pareto³ compression. Use when creating domain ontologies 
or knowledge architectures requiring: (1) Atomic first principles with emergent composites, 
(2) Pareto-optimised information density, (3) Small-world topology with validated node 
ratios (L1:L2 2-3:1), or (4) Bidirectional construction. Integrates with graph (η≥4 
validation), abduct (refactoring), mega (SuperHyperGraphs), infranodus (gap detection). 
Triggers: 'schema generation', 'ontology creation', 'Pareto hierarchy', 'recursive graph', 
'first principles decomposition'.
