Use when extracting entities and relationships, building ontologies, compressing large graphs, or analyzing knowledge structures - provides structural equivalence-based compression achieving 57-95% size reduction, k-bisimulation summarization, categorical quotient constructions, and metagraph hierarchical modeling with scale-invariant properties. Supports recursive refinement through graph topology metrics including |R|/|E| ratios and automorphism analysis.
