Uncertainty-aware non-linear reasoning system with recursive subagent orchestration. Triggers for complex reasoning, research, multi-domain synthesis, or when explicit commands `/nlr`, `/reason`, `/think-deep` are used. Integrates think skill (reasoning), agent-core skill (acting), and MCP tools (infranodus, exa, scholar-gateway) in recursive think→act→observe loops. Uses coding sandbox for execution validation and maintains deliberate noisiness via NoisyGraph scaffold. Supports `/compact` mode for abbreviated outputs and `/semantic` mode for rich exploration.
