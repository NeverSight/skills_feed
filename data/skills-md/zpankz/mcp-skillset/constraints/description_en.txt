Formal constraint theory unifying deontic logic (P/O/F/I operators), Juarrero's trichotomy (enabling/governing/constitutive), Hohfeldian rights (claim-duty, privilege-noright, power-liability, immunity-disability), and category-theoretic composition. Use when modelling permissions, obligations, prohibitions, rights structures, agent authority, governance systems, ontology validation, or any domain requiring formal constraint specification. Integrates with ontolog via λ-calculus mapping.
