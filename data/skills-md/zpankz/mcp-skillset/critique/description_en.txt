Multi-perspective dialectical reasoning with cross-evaluative synthesis. Spawns parallel evaluative lenses (STRUCTURAL, EVIDENTIAL, SCOPE, ADVERSARIAL, PRAGMATIC) that critique thesis AND critique each other's critiques, producing N-squared evaluation matrix before recursive aggregation. Triggers on /critique, /dialectic, /crosseval, requests for thorough analysis, stress-testing arguments, or finding weaknesses. Implements Hegelian refinement enhanced with interleaved multi-domain evaluation and convergent synthesis.
