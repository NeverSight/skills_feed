Implements sophisticated multi-level reasoning for complex problems requiring strategic planning, tactical approach design, and operational execution. Use for problems needing deep analysis, multi-step reasoning, systematic decomposition from first principles to implementation, convergence-aware iterative refinement, or uncertainty quantification across abstraction levels.
