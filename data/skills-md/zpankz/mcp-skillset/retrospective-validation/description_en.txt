Validate methodology effectiveness using historical data without live deployment. Use when rich historical data exists (100+ instances), methodology targets observable patterns (error prevention, test strategy, performance optimization), pattern matching is feasible with clear detection rules, and live deployment has high friction (CI/CD integration effort, user study time, deployment risk). Enables 40-60% time reduction vs prospective validation, 60-80% cost reduction. Confidence calculation model provides statistical rigor. Validated in error recovery (1,336 errors, 23.7% prevention, 0.79 confidence).
