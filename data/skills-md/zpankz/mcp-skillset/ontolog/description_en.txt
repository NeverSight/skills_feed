Holarchic reasoning framework implementing λ-calculus over simplicial complexes. Entities (ο) transform through operations (λ) toward terminals (τ) via the universal form λο.τ. Persistent homology captures multi-scale structure; sheaf theory ensures local-to-global consistency. Use when knowledge requires: (1) homoiconic self-reference where structure mirrors content, (2) scale-invariant holonic decomposition, (3) topological invariants preserved across transformations, or (4) formal Lex-style axiom systems over property graphs.
