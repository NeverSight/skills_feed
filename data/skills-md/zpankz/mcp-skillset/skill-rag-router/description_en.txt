Automatically matches user intent to the most relevant skills from 144+ available options using ck semantic search, LEANN RAG, and knowledge graph relationships. Triggers on /meta queries, complex multi-domain tasks, explicit skill requests, or when task complexity exceeds threshold (files>20, domains>2, complexity>=0.7).
