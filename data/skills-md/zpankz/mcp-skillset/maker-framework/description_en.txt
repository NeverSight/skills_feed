Orchestrate reliable multi-agent reasoning using MAKER (Maximal Agentic Knowledge Engine for Reasoning). Implements three-pillar architecture for transforming probabilistic LLM outputs into deterministic, verifiable results. Use when tasks require high reliability, parallel consensus voting, or systematic error detection. Triggers include reliability-critical tasks, multi-step reasoning chains, consensus-based verification, parallel agent execution, or explicit MAKER invocation.
