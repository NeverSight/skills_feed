Orthogonally-integrated Hegelian syntopical analysis for SAQ/VIVA/concept grounding with systematic textbook citations. Implements thesis extraction → antithesis identification → abductive synthesis across multiple authoritative sources. Tensor-integrated with /m command: activates S×T×L synergies (textbook-grounding × pdf-search × qmd = 0.95). Triggers on requests for model SAQ responses, VIVA preparation, concept explanations requiring textbook evidence, or any PEX exam content needing systematic cross-reference validation.
