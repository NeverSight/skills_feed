Security-first dependency management methodology with batch remediation, policy-driven compliance, and automated enforcement. Use when security vulnerabilities exist in dependencies, dependency freshness low (outdated packages), license compliance needed, or systematic dependency management lacking. Provides security-first prioritization (critical vulnerabilities immediately, high within week, medium within month), batch remediation strategy (group compatible updates, test together, single PR), policy-driven compliance framework (security policies, freshness policies, license policies), and automation tools for vulnerability scanning, update detection, and compliance checking. Validated in meta-cc with 6x speedup (9 hours manual to 1.5 hours systematic), 3 iterations, 88% transferability across package managers (concepts universal, tools vary by ecosystem).
