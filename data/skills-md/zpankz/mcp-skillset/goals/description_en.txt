Optimize prompts via process goals (controllable behavioral instructions) rather than outcome goals (sparse end-result demands). Grounded in sports psychology meta-analysis showing process goals (d=1.36) vastly outperform outcome goals (d=0.09). Use when designing prompts, optimizing LLM steering, implementing CoT/decomposition patterns, or building automatic prompt optimization pipelines. Instantiates surrogate loss paradigm for discrete prompt space.
