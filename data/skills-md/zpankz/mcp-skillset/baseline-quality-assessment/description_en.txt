Achieve comprehensive baseline (V_meta ≥0.40) in iteration 0 to enable rapid convergence. Use when planning iteration 0 time allocation, domain has established practices to reference, rich historical data exists for immediate quantification, or targeting 3-4 iteration convergence. Provides 4 quality levels (minimal/basic/comprehensive/exceptional), component-by-component V_meta calculation guide, and 3 strategies for comprehensive baseline (leverage prior art, quantify baseline, domain universality analysis). 40-50% iteration reduction when V_meta(s₀) ≥0.40 vs <0.20. Spend 3-4 extra hours in iteration 0, save 3-6 hours overall.
