Executable documentation governance with compound engineering and abductive learning. Enforces the Seven Laws through type compilation, schema validation, and hookify-based enforcement. Implements programmatic compound engineering where K' = K ∪ crystallize(assess(τ)) for monotonic knowledge growth. Integrates abstracted abductive learning (OHPT protocol) for systematic debugging and pattern extraction. Trigger when writing code, debugging, establishing governance, or when mentioned vibecode, compound, abductive, or executable documentation. Self-validating and homoiconic.
