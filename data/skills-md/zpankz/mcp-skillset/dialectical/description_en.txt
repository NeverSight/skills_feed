Compose intellectually sophisticated persuasive essays using tripartite dialectical structure (establish-critique-synthesize), paradox accumulation, conversational register calibration, and strategic humility. Supports three atomic writing primitives (AGONAL α, MAIEUTIC β, APOPHATIC γ) with hypersoft plithogenic composition, plus legacy style modes and hybrid combinations. Triggers on requests for persuasive writing to mixed/skeptical audiences, defending counterintuitive claims, Socratic pedagogical dialogue, editorial first-person essays, or writing that must balance accessibility with depth. Implements recursive thematic anchoring, forced dilemma construction, and transformed return closure. Use when linear argumentation is insufficient and accumulated tension resolves through synthesis.
