Universal Reasoning Framework implementing λο.τ calculus over holarchic structures. Provides severity-based routing (R0-R3 pipelines), modular cognitive architecture (DEC, EVL, PAT, SYN, MEA, HYP, INT), fractal execution patterns, multi-level validation (η≥4, KROG), and adaptive learning. Triggers on: (1) complex multi-step reasoning, (2) high-stakes decisions requiring validation, (3) research synthesis across domains, (4) system design and architecture, (5) crisis management, (6) performance optimization. Implements scale-invariant reasoning from micro (tool calls) through meso (skill composition) to macro (orchestrated workflows).
