Leverages the multiple CLIs including PEX, pdf-search, hge, researcher, limitless, pieces, screenapp and more, to extract all relevant LOs across both CICM and ANZCA PEX exams, cross reference them with past SAQ questions, extract examiner comments, cross reference this with recommended textbooks via pdf-search, generate a hypergraph using hge, validate insights with researcher, evaluate against pkm using limitless and pieces, and look for additional context to add polish with screenapp and others. Then leverages the PEX and SAQ skill, as well as the metaskills that exist in .claudeate a scaffolding for a modular, programmatic, state of the art skill that integrates quantitative physiological parameters using the qp skill, teleologically grounded framing using the physiology-style and telos skill and follows all of the principles of the code, mega, and agency skills. Finally it should be recursively optimised with the abduct, critique and refactoring agent skillls. Ergo, this skill makes SOTA PEX LO skills.
