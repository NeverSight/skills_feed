SOTA Docker/Compose architecture, implementation, refactor, and security hardening. Use when working on containerization tasks such as creating or rewriting Dockerfiles, docker-compose files, buildx/bake configs, .dockerignore, and CI pipelines for build/test/scan/publish; auditing existing container setups for security, correctness, size/perf, and best practices (least privilege, non-root, minimal images, pinned base images, BuildKit secrets, healthchecks); debugging Docker build/run issues; or designing dev vs prod compose workflows across services (DB/cache/queues) with correct networking, volumes, secrets, and resource limits.
