# Etsy Listing Analyzer

## Overview

This skill systematically analyzes successful Etsy listings to extract actionable insights for creating winning products. Goes beyond surface-level observation to understand WHY listings succeed.

## Analysis Framework

### Step 1: Identify Listings to Analyze

Select 5-10 top-performing listings for analysis:

**Selection Criteria:**
- First page of search results for target keyword
- Has "Bestseller" badge (proven sales)
- 50+ reviews (established track record)
- Mix of: top sellers AND rising newcomers

**Capture for each listing:**
- URL
- Shop name
- Number of reviews
- Price
- Whether it has Bestseller/Star Seller badge

### Step 2: Visual Analysis (CRITICAL)

Use browser screenshot or image tool to analyze listing images.

**For each listing, evaluate:**

#### Main Image (Thumbnail)
| Factor | What to Look For | Score 1-5 |
|--------|------------------|-----------|
| **Clarity** | Can you instantly tell what it is? | |
| **Contrast** | Does it pop against white/gray? | |
| **Text readability** | If text, is it readable at thumbnail size? | |
| **Style appeal** | Does it match target audience aesthetic? | |
| **Differentiation** | Does it stand out from competitors? | |

#### Image Gallery (All Photos)
| Factor | What to Look For |
|--------|------------------|
| **Number of images** | How many? (Etsy allows 10) |
| **Mockup quality** | Frame mockups, lifestyle shots, flat lays? |
| **Size variations shown** | Do they show different print sizes? |
| **Detail shots** | Close-ups of texture/quality? |
| **Usage context** | Shown in real rooms/settings? |
| **What's included visual** | Bundle contents displayed? |

#### Image Style Patterns
Document the visual style:
- Color palette (warm, cool, neutral, bold)
- Typography style (script, sans-serif, mixed)
- Illustration style (watercolor, line art, minimal, detailed)
- Background (white, textured, colored, transparent)
- Framing (full bleed, bordered, matted look)

### Step 3: Title Analysis

Break down successful titles:

```
Example: "LDS Easter Holy Week Cards | Scripture Study | Primary Activity | Printable PDF | Instant Download"

Structure:
[Primary Keyword] | [Use Case] | [Audience] | [Format] | [Delivery]
```

**Analyze:**
- Word count (Etsy allows 140 characters)
- Keyword placement (front-loaded?)
- Use of separators (|, -, •, ,)
- Emotional/benefit words used
- What's included vs. what's NOT included

### Step 4: Description Analysis

**Opening Hook (First 160 chars - shows in preview)**
- What do they lead with?
- Benefit-focused or feature-focused?
- Call to action present?

**Body Structure**
- Bullet points vs. paragraphs
- What sections do they include?
- How do they describe what's included?
- Do they address objections/FAQs?
- Urgency/scarcity language?

**Common Sections in Top Listings:**
1. ✨ What's Included
2. 📐 Sizes/Dimensions
3. 🖨️ How to Print
4. 📱 Instant Download Instructions
5. ⚠️ Important Notes/Disclaimers
6. 💕 Shop policies/Support

### Step 5: Pricing Analysis

| Listing | Price | What's Included | Price Per Item |
|---------|-------|-----------------|----------------|
| [name] | $X.XX | X items | $X.XX |

**Analyze:**
- Price range in niche (low/mid/high)
- Bundle vs. single pricing
- "Sale" pricing used? (crossed out original)
- Volume discounts offered?
- Price anchoring tactics?

### Step 6: Review Mining

Read 10-20 reviews for insights:

**Extract:**
- **Why they bought** - What need did it fill?
- **What they loved** - Specific praise points
- **Complaints** - What's missing or wrong?
- **Use cases** - How are they actually using it?
- **Buyer language** - Exact words they use (use in your copy!)

**Review Analysis Template:**
```
Positive Themes:
- [theme]: mentioned X times
- [theme]: mentioned X times

Negative Themes:
- [issue]: mentioned X times

Buyer Language (quote directly):
- "[exact phrase buyer used]"
- "[exact phrase buyer used]"
```

### Step 7: Gap Analysis

Compare top sellers to find opportunities:

| Gap Type | What to Look For |
|----------|------------------|
| **Missing products** | What do reviews ask for that doesn't exist? |
| **Quality gaps** | Poor images, bad descriptions to beat |
| **Price gaps** | Underserved price points |
| **Bundle gaps** | Items that should be bundled but aren't |
| **Style gaps** | Aesthetics not being served |
| **Audience gaps** | Submarkets being ignored |

2. Check `references/winning-patterns.md` for proven patterns
3. Apply lessons from previous analyses

**After products launch (30 days later):**
1. Log results in `references/feedback-log.md`
2. Update `references/winning-patterns.md` if new patterns emerge
3. Note what recommendations led to success/failure

## Reference Files

- `references/winning-patterns.md` - Proven image/title/description patterns
