Navigate Python codebases by reading __init__.py files before opening other files in a package. Maintain every __init__.py as living documentation: a top-level docstring containing a one-line package description, a file tree of .py files and subdirectories, and a brief purpose for each entry. Use when: (1) exploring or navigating a Python codebase, (2) creating new Python packages or modules, (3) adding, removing, or renaming files within a Python package, (4) onboarding to an unfamiliar Python project.
