        'ItemIds': [asin],
        'Resources': ['ItemInfo.Title', 'Offers.Listings.Price'],
        'PartnerTag': partner_tag,
        'PartnerType': 'Associates',

## Common Mistakes

### Critical Violations (Account Termination Risk)

### 1. Using URL Shorteners or Redirects

**Problem**: Using bit.ly, TinyURL, or any redirect service
**Why It Matters**: Explicit TOS violation, immediate termination risk
**Solution**: Always use full Amazon affiliate links with your tag visible

### 2. Trademark in Domain Name

**Problem**: Domain names like "amazonreviews.com" or "bestofamazon.com"
**Why It Matters**: Trademark violation, will trigger termination
**Solution**: Use generic or brand-specific domains without "Amazon"

### 3. Incentivizing Purchases

**Problem**: "Buy through my link for a bonus!" or conditional giveaways
**Why It Matters**: Violates program policies, skews conversion data
**Solution**: Never offer incentives, cashback, or rewards for using links

### 4. Personal Use of Affiliate Links

**Problem**: Buying products for yourself through your links
**Why It Matters**: Commission abuse, fraud
**Solution**: Never click or use your own links for purchases

### 5. Inadequate or Missing Disclosures

**Problem**: No disclosure or disclosure buried in footer
**Why It Matters**: FTC violation, legal liability, program breach
**Solution**: Place clear disclosure above fold before first link

### 6. Sending Unsolicited Emails

**Problem**: Buying email lists or sending spam with affiliate links
**Why It Matters**: CAN-SPAM violation, program policy breach
**Solution**: Only email opted-in subscribers, include unsubscribe

### 7. Price Tracking Features

**Problem**: Building price drop alerts or price history tools
**Why It Matters**: Explicitly prohibited in program policies
**Solution**: Do product comparisons instead of price tracking

### 8. Using Amazon Logos Without Links

**Problem**: Displaying Amazon branding not associated with affiliate links
**Why It Matters**: Trademark violation
**Solution**: Only display logos when directly linked to Amazon with your tag

### Content and Strategy Mistakes

### 9. Not Refreshing Cached Data

**Problem**: Showing outdated prices or availability
**Why It Matters**: Technical requirement violation, customer frustration
**Solution**: Refresh all product data within 24 hours, show timestamps

### 10. Over-Optimization (Link Spam)

**Problem**: Too many links in single piece of content
**Why It Matters**: Poor user experience, lower conversions
**Solution**: Limit to 1-3 strategic links per 1,000 words

### 11. Thin or Duplicate Content

**Problem**: Copying manufacturer descriptions, low-value content
