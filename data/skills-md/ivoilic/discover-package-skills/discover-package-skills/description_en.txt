Proactively discover AI rules, prompts, agents, skills, and skill bundles exposed by npm packages in a project, integrate them into editor-specific rule/config files (AGENTS.md, .cursor/rules, .rules, etc.), and, when appropriate, install reusable skills via the skills package (skills.sh). Use this skill when opening a project, after dependencies change, or before relying on a package so you can reuse existing rules/skills instead of recreating them from scratch.
