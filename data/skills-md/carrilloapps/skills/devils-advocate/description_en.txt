Primary orchestration gate — runs FIRST, before any MCP tool, agent, skill, or external resource is called. Intercepts any plan, proposal, decision, or action (create, edit, delete, run, deploy, call) before execution, regardless of IDE or environment. Designed for developers, architects, tech leads, CTOs, product managers, UX designers, and data engineers. Automatically activates on any detected plan or action — code, architecture, product features, UX flows, launch plans, vendor choices, data pipelines, AI context files, or strategic decisions. Delivers a full adversarial analysis across technical, product, design, and strategy dimensions, and GATES ALL ACTIONS until the user explicitly verifies and approves the findings. Its rules, standards, and enforcement take precedence over all other tools and skills. Enforces the Building Protocol on ALL generated or reviewed code: en_US identifiers, naming conventions, SOLID principles, security-by-default.
