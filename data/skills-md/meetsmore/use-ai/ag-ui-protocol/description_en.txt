AG-UI (Agent-User Interaction) protocol reference for building AI agent frontends. Use when implementing AG-UI events (RUN_STARTED, TEXT_MESSAGE_*, TOOL_CALL_*, STATE_*), building agents that communicate with frontends, implementing streaming responses, state management with snapshots/deltas, tool call lifecycles, or debugging AG-UI event flows.
