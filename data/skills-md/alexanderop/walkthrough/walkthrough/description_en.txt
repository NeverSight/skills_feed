Generates a self-contained HTML file with an interactive, clickable Mermaid diagram (flowchart or ER diagram) that explains how a codebase feature, flow, architecture, or database schema works. Designed for fast onboarding — each walkthrough is a visual mental model readable in under 2 minutes. Use when asked to walkthrough, explain a flow, trace a code path, show how something works, explain the architecture, visualize a database schema, or explore a data model.
