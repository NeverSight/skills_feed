Use the Docyrus Architect MCP tools to manage data sources, fields, enums, apps, and query data in the Docyrus platform. Use when the user asks to create, update, delete, or query data sources, fields, enum options, or apps via the docyrus-architect MCP server. Also use when building reports, dashboards, or performing data analysis that requires querying Docyrus data sources with filters, aggregations, formulas, pivots, or child queries.
