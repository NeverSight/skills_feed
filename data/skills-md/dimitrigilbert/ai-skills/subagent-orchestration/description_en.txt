Orchestrate multi-phase development workflows with strict role separation between implementers and validators. Automatically executes plans using separate subagents for implementation, validation, and fixing with auto-retry loops. Use when building complex systems requiring (1) Multi-step sequential or parallel development phases, (2) Automated validation with typecheck/build/tests after each phase, (3) Auto-retry fix loops until validation passes, (4) Complete execution after single user approval. Triggers include "implement this multi-phase plan", "build a system with phases", "create [complex system] following this architecture", "automate development workflow with validation", or any request for orchestrated development with multiple phases and quality checks. NOT for simple single-file tasks or exploratory coding.
