End-to-end Remotion video production from natural language briefs. Orchestrates narrative structure, scene animation, visual style, and rendering to produce complete promotional videos. Use when a user wants to create a complete video (product promo, typographic piece, social media animation) — not just individual animation effects. Coordinates gsap-animation, spring-animation, and react-animation skills as building blocks.
