Apply professional color theming to Figma diagrams (flowcharts, decision trees, sequence diagrams, state diagrams, gantt charts). Use this skill whenever creating diagrams with the Figma:generate_diagram tool. Automatically assigns distinct colors to top-level branches, with child nodes inheriting their parent branch's color family for clear visual hierarchy.
