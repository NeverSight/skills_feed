Visual identity system for Pitolandia, a consent-first date planning service. Use when generating images, illustrations, or visual content for Pitolandia brand materials. Triggers include requests for venue illustrations, food/drink specimen plates, desert landscapes, or any visual asset in the "Sonoran Gothic Surrealism" aesthetic—19th-century copperplate engravings with hand-tinted watercolor washes. Also use when transforming source photographs into the Pitolandia style for fair-use purposes, or when crafting AI image generation prompts for Pitolandia content.
