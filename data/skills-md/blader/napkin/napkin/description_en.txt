Maintain a per-repo napkin file that tracks mistakes, corrections, and
what works. Activates EVERY session, unconditionally. Read the napkin
before doing anything. Write to it continuously as you work — not just at
session boundaries. Log your own mistakes, not just user corrections. The
napkin lives in the repo at `.claude/napkin.md`.
