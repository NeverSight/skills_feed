Reverse engineer a detailed product and technical specification document from a git branch's
implementation. Use when: (1) a branch has shipped or is in-progress and needs documentation,
(2) you need to understand what a branch does at product and architecture level, (3) onboarding
to someone else's feature branch, (4) creating PR descriptions or design docs after the fact,
(5) user asks to "analyze this branch", "write a spec from the code", or "document what this
branch does". Produces a structured markdown spec covering problem statement, product requirements,
architecture, technical design, file inventories, testing strategy, rollout plan, and risks.
