Analyze and optimize individual pages for conversion performance. Use when the user wants to improve conversion rates, diagnose why a page is underperforming, or increase the effectiveness of marketing pages (homepage, landing pages, pricing, feature pages, or blog posts). This skill focuses on diagnosis, prioritization, and testable recommendations— not blind optimization.
