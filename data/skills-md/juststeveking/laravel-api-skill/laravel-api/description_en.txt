Build production-grade Laravel REST APIs using opinionated architecture patterns with Laravel best practices. Use when building, scaffoling, or reviewing Laravel APIs with specifications for stateless design, versioned endpoints, invokable controllers, Form Request DTOs, Action classes, JWT authentication, and PSR-12 code quality standards. Triggers on "build a Laravel API", "create Laravel endpoints", "add API authentication", "review Laravel API code", "refactor Laravel API", or "improve Laravel code quality".
