Node.js bindings for Rust libraries using napi-rs. Use when working on Node.js/JavaScript bindings to Rust code, including creating or modifying napi macros and structs, converting types between Rust and JavaScript, handling errors across the FFI boundary, async/Promise patterns, building native modules, publishing to npm, testing binding code, or debugging binding issues. Tuned for CQLite (Cassandra CQL bindings) with feature parity tracking.
