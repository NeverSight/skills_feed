Perform a comprehensive read-only security audit of Clawdbot's own configuration. This is a knowledge-based skill that teaches Clawdbot to identify hardening opportunities and generate reports. Use when user asks to "run security check", "audit clawdbot", "check security hardening", or "what vulnerabilities do I have". This skill only READS configuration and generates reports—it never modifies settings or executes fixes automatically. Designed to be extensible—new checks can be added by updating this skill's knowledge.
