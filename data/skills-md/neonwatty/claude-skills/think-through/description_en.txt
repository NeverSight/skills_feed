A Socratic interview skill for thinking through technical ideas like apps, products, tools, and projects. Use this when the user says "think through [idea]", "help me think about [app/product]", "let's explore [project idea]", or wants to iterate on a technical concept before building. Asks probing questions about the problem, target users, market, technical approach, tradeoffs, and viability. Continues until the idea is well-explored, then produces a written summary and proposes directions.
