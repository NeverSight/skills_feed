Deeply interviews the user about a bug before investigating or fixing it. Use this when the user says "interview me about [bug]", "I have a bug to report", "let's work on this bug", "found a bug", "there's a bug", or describes a bug they encountered. Asks probing questions about reproduction steps, environment, patterns, impact, and context that help isolate the root cause. Continues until the bug is well-understood, then writes a detailed investigation/fix plan.
