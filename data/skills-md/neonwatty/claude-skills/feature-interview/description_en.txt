Deeply interviews the user about a feature idea before implementation. Use this when the user says "interview me about [feature]", "I want to create a new feature", "let's create a new feature", "new feature", "plan a feature", or describes a feature they want to build. Asks probing, non-obvious questions about technical implementation, UI/UX decisions, edge cases, concerns, tradeoffs, and constraints. Continues interviewing until the feature is fully understood, then writes a detailed implementation plan.
