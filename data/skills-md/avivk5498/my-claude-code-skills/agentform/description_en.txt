Create and debug Agentform AI agent configurations (.af files). Use when:
(1) Creating new agentform projects or workflows
(2) Debugging agentform syntax errors
(3) Adding MCP server integrations

Agentform is "Infrastructure as Code for AI agents" - declarative .af files define agents, workflows, and policies.
