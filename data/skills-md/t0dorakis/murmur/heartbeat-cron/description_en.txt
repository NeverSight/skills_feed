Create and refine HEARTBEAT.md files for murmur — a CLI daemon that runs scheduled Claude prompts on a cron or interval schedule. Use this skill when the user wants to set up a recurring automated action (e.g., "monitor my GitHub issues", "check Hacker News for AI articles", "watch my endpoints", "send me a daily digest"). Guides the user through an interview, drafts the heartbeat prompt, tests it, and registers it with murmur's scheduler. Triggers: heartbeat, murmur, recurring task, scheduled action, cron, monitor, watch, automate, periodic check, scheduled prompt.
