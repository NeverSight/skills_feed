Use this skill when the user asks to build, create, design, develop, or improve ANY frontend interface, web page, UI component, or visual element. This includes:
- Building landing pages, websites, web apps, dashboards, portfolios, or any web interface
- Creating UI components (buttons, forms, cards, navbars, modals, etc.)
- Designing pages with React, Vue, Next.js, Svelte, or any frontend framework
- Adding styling or improving visual design of existing components
- Implementing specific design aesthetics (modern, dark, minimalist, brutalist, etc.)
- User mentions "frontend", "UI", "UX", "design", "interface", "web design", or "styling"
- User asks for "beautiful", "modern", "professional", "clean", or any aesthetic adjective
- User requests help with CSS, Tailwind, styled-components, or any styling approach

This skill automatically retrieves the appropriate design system prompt (Neo-brutalism, Modern Dark, Bauhaus, Cyberpunk, Material, etc.) to help create visually distinctive, production-grade frontend code instead of generic UI.

IMPORTANT: Trigger this skill proactively for ANY frontend/UI work, not just when design style is explicitly mentioned.
