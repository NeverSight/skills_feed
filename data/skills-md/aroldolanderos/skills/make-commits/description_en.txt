Analyzes git changes and generates semantic commits iteratively with [Why]/[What]/[Impact] structure. Groups related files, allows manual editing, and executes git add + commit. Use when you have uncommitted changes and need structured messages following conventional commits (feat, fix, docs, refactor, etc.).
