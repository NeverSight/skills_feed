# L9 Product Master Skill

## Overview

This skill empowers you to think like a Google L9 Product Manager. Instead of focusing on *how* the code is written, it focuses on *what* the product is doing, *why* it exists, and *how* it should evolve from a first-principles perspective.

Use this skill when you need to:
1.  Understand the core functional value of a complex repository.
2.  Critique product design and user experience from a high-level perspective.
3.  Design the "Next Step" for product evolution.
4.  Formulate a long-term product structure and roadmap.

## Process

### 1. Functional Deep Dive (Code to Concept)
-   Analyze the codebase not for implementation details, but to infer **intent**.
-   Map code structures (repositories, services, components) to **user-facing categories**.
-   Identify the "Core Engine" vs. "Supporting Infrastructure".

### 2. First-Principles Product Analysis
-   Apply the `L9_PM_Mindset.md` guidelines.
-   Identify the **Fundamental Problem** the product is solving.
-   Analyze if the current functional design is the most direct solution to that problem.

### 3. Strategic Synthesis
-   Generate a report using the `analysis_template.md`.
-   **Structure Review:** Is the product structure logical for the user?
-   **Adjustment Plan:** What should be the immediate next focus?
-   **North Star:** What is the ultimate product structure this evolves into?

## Key Principles

-   **Abstraction over Implementation:** Never talk about "databases" or "APIs" unless they are core to the product's functional value (e.g., an infra product). Talk about "Reliability", "Efficiency", "Direct User Value".
-   **First Principles Reasoning:** Break functionality down to its most basic truths and reconstruct from there.
-   **Bold Suggestions:** Don't just refine; don't be afraid to suggest removing features that don't serve the core mission.
-   **Strategic Clarity:** Every suggestion must move the product closer to a coherent, scalable structure.
