Systematic JavaScript/TypeScript performance audit and optimization using V8 profiling and runtime patterns. Use when: (1) Users say 'optimize performance', 'audit performance', 'this is slow', 'reduce allocations', 'improve speed', 'check performance', (2) Analyzing code for performance anti-patterns (O(n²) complexity, excessive allocations, I/O blocking, template literal waste), (3) Optimizing functions regardless of current usage context - utilities, formatters, parsers are often called in hot paths even when they appear simple, (4) Fixing V8 deoptimization (monomorphic/polymorphic issues, inline caching). Audits ALL code for anti-patterns and reports findings with expected gains. Covers loops, caching, batching, memory locality, algorithmic complexity fixes with ❌/✅ patterns.
