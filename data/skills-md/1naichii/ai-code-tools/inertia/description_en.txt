Use when creating Inertia pages and layouts, working with Link component for navigation, building forms with Form component or useForm hook, handling validation and errors, managing shared data and props, implementing authentication and authorization, using manual visits with router, working with partial reloads, setting up persistent layouts, or configuring client-side setup.
