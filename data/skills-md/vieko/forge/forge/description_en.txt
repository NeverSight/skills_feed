Verification boundary CLI that delegates tasks to autonomous agents. Use when the user wants to run forge, execute specs, run specs in parallel, run pending specs, define specs from a description, resolve specs, audit code against specs, review changes, watch live logs, check run status, resume a session, or delegate complex multi-step work to an autonomous agent. Triggers include "forge run", "run this spec", "run specs in parallel", "run pending", "forge define", "define specs", "audit the codebase", "review changes", "forge watch", "forge status", "rerun failed", "resolve spec", "delegate this to forge".
