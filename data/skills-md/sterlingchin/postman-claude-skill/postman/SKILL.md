# Postman Agent Skill

**Version**: 1.1.0 (Phase 1 - Core API Compatibility)
**API Support**: Postman v10+ (with v9 graceful degradation)

## 🚀 Quick Start

**When you first use this skill, Claude will automatically:**
1. ✅ Validate your API key and connection
2. 📁 Check your workspace configuration
3. 📊 Count your collections and resources
4. 💡 Suggest next steps if setup is incomplete

**First time setup validation:**
```bash
# Claude will run this automatically on first use
python scripts/validate_setup.py
```

**Common first questions that work immediately:**
- "How many collections do I have?" - Lists all collections in your workspace
- "Show me my workspaces" - Displays available workspaces
- "Validate my setup" - Runs comprehensive diagnostics
- "Create a new collection called 'Test API'" - Starts building immediately

**🤖 Note for Claude**: On first use of this skill in a conversation, ALWAYS run:
```bash
python scripts/validate_setup.py
```
This provides immediate diagnostics and context before proceeding with the user's request.

## ✅ Network Compatibility

This skill works across multiple Claude environments with proper proxy configuration.

### Where This Skill Works

| Environment | Status | Notes |
|------------|--------|-------|
| **Claude Web Interface** | ✅ **Fully Supported** | Works with configured proxy |
| **Claude API** (Code Execution) | ✅ **Fully Supported** | No network restrictions |
| **Local Python Scripts** | ✅ **Fully Supported** | Direct execution on your machine |
| **Claude Desktop** | ⚠️ **Limited** | Requires `api.getpostman.com` in network allowlist |

### Proxy Configuration

The skill is designed to work with proxy environments:
- **Keeps proxy environment variables intact** for proper DNS resolution
- **Handles nested HTTP responses** from proxy servers
- **Supports HTTP/2 responses** through proxies
- **Debug mode available** with `POSTMAN_DEBUG=1` environment variable

### How to Use This Skill

**Option 1: Claude Web Interface (Recommended)**
Use the skill directly in Claude web interface. The proxy is pre-configured and handles all network requests automatically.

**Option 2: Claude API with Code Execution**
Use the skill through the Anthropic API with code execution enabled. This has no network restrictions.

**Option 3: Local Python Scripts**
Run the scripts directly on your machine:
```bash
python scripts/list_collections.py
python scripts/manage_collections.py --list
```

## When to Use This Skill

Claude should use this skill when you:
- Mention Postman, collections, API specifications, or API testing
- Want to create or manage API specifications (OpenAPI, AsyncAPI, Swagger)
- Need to upload or import API specs to Postman
- Want to generate collections from API specifications
- Want to generate specifications from existing collections
- Want to validate API schemas or compare versions
- Want to create, update, or delete collections or environments
- Need to duplicate or organize collections and environments
- Ask to check authentication or security configuration
- Ask to create mock servers for prototyping
- Ask to run tests or check test results
- Want to see what APIs/collections/specs are available
- Need to create, manage, or analyze monitors
- Ask about API uptime, monitoring, or observability
- Want to check monitor status or run history
- Ask about API documentation quality or access

## Prerequisites

This skill requires a `.env` file with your Postman API key. The `.env` file should be included in the skill package and is automatically loaded when any script runs.

**Important**: If the skill is asking for an API key, it means the `.env` file is either:
- Missing from the skill package
- Empty or incorrectly formatted
- Not readable by the scripts

**To fix**: Ensure the skill package includes a `.env` file with:
```
POSTMAN_API_KEY=PMAK-your-key-here
```

Optional configuration in `.env`:
```
POSTMAN_WORKSPACE_ID=your-workspace-id
POSTMAN_RATE_LIMIT_DELAY=60
POSTMAN_MAX_RETRIES=3
POSTMAN_TIMEOUT=30
# POSTMAN_USE_PROXY=false  # Keep this false to bypass proxies (default)
```

## Proxy Configuration (Important for Corporate Networks)

**By default, the skill bypasses all proxy servers** to avoid "403 Forbidden" proxy errors that commonly occur in Claude Desktop.

If you see errors like:
- `ProxyError: Unable to connect to proxy`
- `Tunnel connection failed: 403 Forbidden`

**The skill automatically handles this** - no action needed. The latest version bypasses proxies by default.

If you're in a corporate environment and **need** to use a proxy:
1. Add `POSTMAN_USE_PROXY=true` to your `.env` file
2. Ensure your proxy allows connections to `api.getpostman.com`

## Getting Your Postman API Key

1. Go to https://web.postman.co/settings/me/api-keys
2. Click "Generate API Key"
3. Copy the key (starts with `PMAK-`)
4. Add it to the `.env` file in the skill directory

## How to Use This Skill - IMPORTANT

**⚠️ CRITICAL: All Postman API calls MUST be made through Python scripts**

This skill uses Python scripts to interact with the Postman API. **DO NOT** attempt to call api.postman.com directly using HTTP requests, as this will fail due to CORS (Cross-Origin Resource Sharing) restrictions in browser environments.

**Always use the Python scripts:**
```python
# ✅ CORRECT: Use Python scripts
python /path/to/postman-skill/scripts/list_collections.py

# ❌ WRONG: Direct API calls will fail with CORS errors
# fetch('https://api.getpostman.com/collections')  # This will NOT work
```

**Why this matters:**
- The Python `requests` library is not subject to CORS restrictions
- Direct browser-based API calls to api.postman.com are blocked by CORS
- All scripts automatically load your API key from the `.env` file

## Example Usage

### Basic Operations

**List all collections:**
```bash
python /skills/postman-skill/scripts/list_collections.py
```

**Create a new collection:**
```bash
python /skills/postman-skill/scripts/manage_collections.py --create --name "My API Tests"
```

**Create an environment with auto-secret detection (v1.1):**
```python
from scripts.postman_client import PostmanClient

client = PostmanClient()
env = client.create_environment(
    name="Production",
    values={
        "base_url": "https://api.example.com",
        "api_key": "secret-key-123",      # Auto-detected as secret! 🔐
        "bearer_token": "bearer-xyz-456"  # Auto-detected as secret! 🔐
    }
)
```

### Spec Hub Workflows (NEW!)

**Create an API specification:**
```python
import json
from scripts.postman_client import PostmanClient

client = PostmanClient()

# Create OpenAPI 3.0 spec
openapi_spec = {
    "openapi": "3.0.0",
    "info": {"title": "My API", "version": "1.0.0"},
    "paths": {"/users": {"get": {"responses": {"200": {"description": "Success"}}}}}
}

spec = client.create_spec({
    "name": "My API",
    "description": "A sample API",
    "files": [{
        "path": "openapi.json",
        "content": json.dumps(openapi_spec),
        "root": True
    }]
})
print(f"Created spec: {spec['id']}")
```

**Generate collection from spec:**
```python
# Automatically create a collection from your spec
result = client.generate_collection_from_spec(
    spec_id,
    collection_name="My API Collection"
)
```

**Generate spec from collection:**
```python
# Create a spec from an existing collection
result = client.generate_spec_from_collection(
    collection_id="collection-12345",
    spec_name="Generated API Spec"
)
```

**Run the complete example:**
```bash
python scripts/manage_pet_store_spec.py
```

### Version Control Workflows (v1.1 - v10+ Required)

**Fork a collection:**
```python
# Create a fork for independent development
fork = client.fork_collection(
    collection_uid="12345-abcde",
    label="feature-new-tests"
)
print(f"Forked collection: {fork['uid']}")
```

**Create a pull request:**
```python
# Propose merging your changes
pr = client.create_pull_request(
    collection_uid="12345-abcde",      # Parent collection
    source_collection_uid=fork['uid'], # Your fork
    title="Add authentication tests",
    description="This PR adds comprehensive auth test coverage"
)
```

**Merge a pull request:**
```python
# Merge approved changes
client.merge_pull_request("12345-abcde", pr['id'])
```

**Duplicate a collection:**
```python
# Create a standalone copy (not a fork)
backup = client.duplicate_collection(
    collection_uid="12345-abcde",
    name="My Collection Backup"
)
```

**Validate API schema:**
```python
# See: workflows/design/validate_schema.md
from scripts.postman_client import PostmanClient
client = PostmanClient()
schemas = client.get_api_schema(api_id="<api-id>", version_id="<version-id>")
```

**Check authentication configuration:**
```python
# See: workflows/secure/check_auth.md
collection = client.get_collection(collection_uid="<collection-id>")
auth_type = collection.get('auth', {}).get('type', 'No auth')
```

**Create a mock server:**
```python
# See: workflows/deploy/manage_mocks.md
mock_data = {"name": "API Mock", "collection": "<collection-uid>"}
mock = client.create_mock(mock_data)
print(f"Mock URL: {mock['mockUrl']}")
```

**Run a specific collection:**
```bash
python /skills/postman-skill/scripts/run_collection.py --collection="My API Tests"
```

**List all monitors:**
```bash
python /skills/postman-skill/scripts/manage_monitors.py --list
```

**Analyze monitor run history:**
```bash
python /skills/postman-skill/scripts/manage_monitors.py --analyze <monitor-id> --limit 20
```

## Error Handling (Enhanced in v1.1)

All scripts include:
- **Custom Exception Classes**: Specific exceptions for each error type
  - `AuthenticationError` (401) - Invalid API key with setup instructions
  - `PermissionError` (403) - Insufficient permissions with resolution steps
  - `ResourceNotFoundError` (404) - Missing resources with possible causes
  - `ValidationError` (400) - Request validation failures with details
  - `RateLimitError` (429) - Rate limit exceeded with retry-after info
  - `ServerError` (5xx) - Server errors with status page link
  - `NetworkError` - Connection issues with troubleshooting steps
  - `TimeoutError` - Request timeouts with configuration guidance
- **Automatic retry** with exponential backoff (3 attempts)
- **Helpful error messages** with resolution guidance
- **API version detection** with compatibility warnings
- **Rate limit handling** with automatic backoff

### Error Message Example

Before (v1.0):
```
Exception: API request failed with status 404: Resource not found
```

After (v1.1):
```
ResourceNotFoundError: Collection with ID '12345' was not found.

Possible reasons:
- The resource was deleted
- The ID is incorrect
- You don't have permission to access it
- The resource is in a different workspace
```

## Security (Enhanced in v1.1)

- API keys read from environment variables only
- All operations scoped to configured workspace
- Rate limiting with automatic backoff
- No sensitive data logged or cached
- 🆕 **Automatic secret detection** for environment variables
- 🆕 **Secret type preservation** across updates and duplication
- 🆕 **11 sensitive keywords** monitored (api_key, token, password, bearer, auth, etc.)
- 🆕 **No accidental exposure** of credentials in default-typed variables

## Limitations

- Runs in code execution container (no network access restrictions apply to API calls)
- Maximum 8MB skill size
- Uses pre-installed Python packages only
- Collection forking and pull requests require Postman v10+ API
- Some enterprise features may require paid Postman plans

## API Version Compatibility

This skill is optimized for **Postman v10+ APIs** but maintains graceful degradation:

| Feature | v9 API | v10+ API |
|---------|--------|----------|
| Collections CRUD | ✅ Best Effort | ✅ Full Support |
| Collection Forking | ❌ Not Available | ✅ Full Support |
| Pull Requests | ❌ Not Available | ✅ Full Support |
| Environments CRUD | ✅ Best Effort | ✅ Full Support |
| Secret Variables | ⚠️ Limited | ✅ Full Support |
| Custom Exceptions | ✅ Full Support | ✅ Full Support |
| Version Detection | ✅ Full Support | ✅ Full Support |

The client automatically detects your API version and will show warnings if v10+ features are unavailable.

## Next Steps

**After loading this skill (Claude Instructions):**
1. **ALWAYS run setup validation first**: `python scripts/validate_setup.py`
   - This provides immediate diagnostics and workspace context
   - Identifies configuration issues proactively
   - Shows collection counts and helpful next steps
2. If validation fails:
   - Check if `POSTMAN_API_KEY` is set in `.env` file
   - Guide user to get their key from https://web.postman.co/settings/me/api-keys
3. For "How many collections?" queries:
   - Run `python scripts/list_collections.py`
   - If 0 collections found, suggest:
     - List workspaces: `python scripts/list_workspaces.py`
     - Create new collection
     - Switch workspace in `.env` file
4. Execute specific workflows based on user requests

**Helpful diagnostic commands:**
- Setup validation: `python scripts/validate_setup.py`
- List collections: `python scripts/list_collections.py`
- List workspaces: `python scripts/list_workspaces.py`
- List all resources: `python scripts/list_collections.py --all`
