# AI Prompting & LLM Patterns

Prompt engineering techniques and LLM interaction patterns for Claude, GPT, and other AI models.

## Prompt Techniques

### Basic Structure
```
Role: [Specify role/expertise]
Task: [Clear, specific task]
Context: [Relevant background]
Format: [Desired output format]
Constraints: [Any limitations]
```

### Few-Shot Prompting
Provide 2-3 examples of input-output pairs before the actual request to guide model behavior.

### Chain-of-Thought
Ask model to "explain your reasoning step by step" for complex tasks. Improves accuracy on logical problems.

### System Prompts
Design detailed system prompts that establish persona, expertise level, and behavioral guidelines.

## Key Strategies

1. **Clarity** - Be specific and unambiguous
2. **Examples** - Provide concrete examples
3. **Constraints** - Define output format and limits
4. **Role Definition** - Specify expertise and perspective
5. **Iterative Refinement** - Test and improve prompts

## Common Patterns

- Classification & Categorization
- Text Generation & Creative Writing
- Code Generation & Debugging
- Data Extraction & Parsing
- Analysis & Reasoning
- Summarization & Synthesis
- Translation & Conversion
- Problem Solving & Ideation
