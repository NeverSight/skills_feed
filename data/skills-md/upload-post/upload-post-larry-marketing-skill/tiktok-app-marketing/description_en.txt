Automate TikTok + Instagram slideshow marketing for any app or product. Researches competitors, generates AI images, adds text overlays, posts via Upload-Post (multi-platform in one API call), tracks analytics, and iterates on what works. Use when setting up TikTok marketing automation, creating slideshow posts, analyzing post performance, optimizing app marketing funnels, or when a user mentions TikTok growth, slideshow ads, or social media marketing for their app. Covers competitor research (browser-based), image generation, text overlays, multi-platform posting (Upload-Post API — TikTok + Instagram + more simultaneously), analytics tracking, hook testing, CTA optimization, conversion tracking with RevenueCat, and a full feedback loop that adjusts hooks and CTAs based on views vs conversions.
