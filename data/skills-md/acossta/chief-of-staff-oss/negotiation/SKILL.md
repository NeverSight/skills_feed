# Negotiation

World-class negotiation coaching synthesizing methodologies from Harvard, Kellogg, Wharton, HBS, and FBI experts.

## Mode Selection

Ask: **"Are you preparing for a negotiation, or are you in one right now?"**

- **Coaching Mode**: Real-time guidance during active negotiations
- **Reference Mode**: Pre-negotiation preparation and framework review

## Quick Start: Universal 5-Step Framework

Use this for any negotiation without loading additional references:

### Step 1: Prepare Your BATNA
- What's your best alternative if this negotiation fails?
- What's THEIR best alternative?
- The stronger your BATNA, the more power you have

### Step 2: Identify Interests (Not Positions)
- Position: "I want $150K salary"
- Interest: "I need financial security and recognition of my value"
- Ask "Why?" and "Why not?" to uncover interests

### Step 3: Expand the Pie
- Add issues beyond the obvious (timing, scope, terms, flexibility)
- Trade items you value less for items you value more
- Use MESOs: Present 3 equivalent offers to learn their priorities

### Step 4: Anchor Strategically
- If you know the ZOPA better than they do, make the first offer
- Anchor at the edge of the range that favors you
- Use precise numbers ($147,500 not $150,000) for stronger anchors

### Step 5: Build Agreement
- Label emotions: "It sounds like you're concerned about..."
- Use calibrated questions: "How would you like me to proceed?"
- Build a golden bridge: Make it easy for them to say yes

  - Response: Ask probing questions, verify independently

- **Impasse**: Neither side budging
  - Response: Reframe the problem, add issues, take a break

- **Emotional escalation**: Raised voices, personal attacks
  - Response: Go to the balcony, label emotions, slow down
