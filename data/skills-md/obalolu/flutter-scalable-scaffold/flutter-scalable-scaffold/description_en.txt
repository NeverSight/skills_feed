Create production-ready Flutter mobile app projects with clean architecture, feature-based structure, state management (flutter_bloc/riverpod), routing, theming, networking, secure storage, and reusable components. Includes dependency injection, custom widgets, flavors (dev/prod), environment variables, and backend integration (custom/Firebase/Supabase). Use this skill when users want to scaffold a complete Flutter project with a scalable, production-ready structure.
