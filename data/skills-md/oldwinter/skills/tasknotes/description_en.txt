This skill should be used when users mention tasks, todos, work items, Obsidian notes, or need to manage their personal task list. It integrates with the TaskNotes CLI (tn) to list, create, update, complete, and organize tasks stored in Obsidian. Triggers on keywords like "task", "todo", "任务", "工作", "待办", "Obsidian", or when users ask about their schedule, deadlines, or what they need to do.
