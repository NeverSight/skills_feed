Resend Box is a local email sandbox that mocks the Resend API and captures emails for inspection. Use this skill when working with the Resend SDK or SMTP to send emails during development. It captures all emails sent via the Resend SDK (when RESEND_BASE_URL points to the sandbox) or via SMTP (port 1025). Use to verify emails are sent correctly, inspect email content, or test email templates without sending real emails.
