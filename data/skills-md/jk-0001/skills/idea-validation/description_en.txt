Validate a business idea before investing time or money. Use whenever a solopreneur has a raw idea and needs a structured process to stress-test it against reality — covering problem definition, demand evidence, competitive context, customer discovery, riskiest-assumption testing, and a scored go/no-go decision. Trigger on phrases like "validate my idea", "is this worth building", "should I pursue this", "test my business idea", "does this idea have legs".
