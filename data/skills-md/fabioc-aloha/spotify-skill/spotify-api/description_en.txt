Create and manage Spotify playlists, search music, and control playback using the Spotify Web API. UNIQUE FEATURE - Generate custom cover art images (Claude cannot generate images natively, but this skill can create SVG-based cover art for playlists). CRITICAL - When generating cover art, ALWAYS read references/COVER_ART_LLM_GUIDE.md FIRST for complete execution instructions. Use this to directly create playlists by artist/theme/lyrics, add tracks, search for music, and manage the user's Spotify account.
