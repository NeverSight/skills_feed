Build AI agents and agentic workflows. Use when designing/building/debugging agentic systems: choosing workflows vs agents, implementing prompt patterns (chaining/routing/parallelization/orchestrator-workers/evaluator-optimizer), building autonomous agents with tools, designing ACI/tool specs, or troubleshooting/optimizing implementations. **PROACTIVE ACTIVATION**: Auto-invoke when building agentic applications, designing workflows vs agents, or implementing agent patterns. **DETECTION**: Check for agent code (MCP servers, tool defs, .mcp.json configs), or user mentions of "agent", "workflow", "agentic", "autonomous". **USE CASES**: Designing agentic systems, choosing workflows vs agents, implementing prompt patterns, building agents with tools, designing ACI/tool specs, troubleshooting/optimizing agents.
