TDD-based code simplification that preserves behavior through tests. Use Red-Green-Refactor cycles to simplify code one test-verified change at a time. **DISTINCT FROM**: General code review or AI rewriting—this skill requires existing tests and only proceeds when tests confirm behavior is preserved. **PROACTIVE**: Auto-invoke when test-covered code has complexity (functions >50 lines, high cyclomatic complexity, duplication) and user wants to simplify it safely. Trigger phrases: 'clean up code', 'make code simpler', 'reduce complexity', 'refactoring help'. **NOT FOR**: Adding features or fixing bugs—use /tdd skill instead.
