Add an external skill from a GitHub repository to the current workspace. Use when users want to import, install, or add a skill from a GitHub URL (e.g., `/add-skill https://github.com/OpenHands/skills/tree/main/skills/codereview` or "add the codereview skill from https://github.com/OpenHands/skills/"). Handles fetching the skill files and placing them in .openhands/skills/.
