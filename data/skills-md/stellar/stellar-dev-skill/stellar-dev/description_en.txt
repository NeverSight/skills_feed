Covers Soroban smart contracts (Rust SDK), Stellar CLI, JavaScript/Python/Go SDKs for client apps, Stellar RPC (preferred) and Horizon API (legacy), Stellar Assets vs Soroban tokens (SAC bridge), wallet integration (Freighter, Stellar Wallets Kit), smart accounts with passkeys, status-sensitive zero-knowledge proof patterns, testing strategies, security patterns, and common pitfalls. Optimized for payments, asset tokenization, DeFi, privacy-aware applications, and financial applications. Use when building on Stellar, Soroban, or working with XLM, Stellar Assets, trustlines, anchors, SEPs, ZK proofs, or the Stellar RPC/Horizon APIs.
