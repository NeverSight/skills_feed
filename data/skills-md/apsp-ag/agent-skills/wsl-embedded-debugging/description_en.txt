Run embedded build/flash/debug workflows from WSL by invoking Windows executables that own USB/JTAG access (for example `cargo.exe`, `probe-rs.exe`, or `openocd.exe`). Use when an agent must reproduce firmware behavior on hardware, flash an MCU, collect bounded runtime logs, or debug probe connectivity from a WSL workspace.
