Guide for building Vue 3 components with NuxtUI using strict Test-Driven Development (TDD) methodology enforced by a TDD guard hook. Use this skill when implementing new UI components (atoms, molecules, organisms) for the Poche project, creating Storybook stories with interaction tests, or working within the RED-GREEN-REFACTOR cycle. Particularly useful when the user mentions "TDD", "test-first", "create a component", "build a component", "implement [ComponentName]", or when adding UI functionality.
