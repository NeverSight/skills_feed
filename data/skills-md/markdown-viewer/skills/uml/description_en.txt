Create UML (Unified Modeling Language) diagrams using drawio XML format. Best for software modeling including Class, Sequence, Activity, State Machine, Component, Use Case, and Deployment diagrams. Built on drawio with UML-specific shapes and notation. NOT for simple flowcharts (use mermaid), layered system architecture (use architecture), or data charts (use vega).
