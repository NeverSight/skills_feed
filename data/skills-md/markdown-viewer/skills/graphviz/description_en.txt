Create complex directed/undirected graphs with precise layout control. Best for dependency trees, org charts, network topologies, and module relationships. Use when you need fine-grained edge routing or hierarchical layouts with many levels. NOT for simple flowcharts (use mermaid) or data charts (use vega).
