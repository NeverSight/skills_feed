Create cloud architecture diagrams using drawio XML format with official cloud provider icons. Best for AWS, Azure, GCP, Alibaba Cloud architecture diagrams with proper service icons and layout conventions. Built on drawio with cloud-specific stencils. NOT for simple flowcharts (use mermaid) or network topology without cloud services (use network skill).
