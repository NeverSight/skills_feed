Create professional engineering diagrams using drawio XML format with industry-standard symbols. Best for electrical schematics, P&ID (Piping & Instrumentation), rack diagrams, fault tree analysis, PLC ladder logic, and logic gate diagrams. Built on drawio with engineering-specific stencils. NOT for simple flowcharts (use mermaid) or network topology (use network skill).
