Create data-driven charts with Vega-Lite (simple) and Vega (advanced). Best for bar, line, scatter, heatmap, area charts, and multi-series analytics. Use when you have numeric data arrays needing statistical visualization. Vega for radar charts and word clouds. NOT for process diagrams (use mermaid) or quick KPI cards (use infographic).
