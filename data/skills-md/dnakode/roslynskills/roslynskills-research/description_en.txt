Roslyn-first C#/.NET coding workflow using RoslynSkills (roscli). Use when user asks for symbol navigation, semantic context, structured refactors (rename/transactions), workspace-backed diagnostics triage, or evidence capture for benchmark runs. Avoid for non-C# repos or tasks that do not need semantic certainty.
