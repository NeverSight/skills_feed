Extract reusable UI/UX design systems from frontend codebases: design tokens, global styles, components, interaction patterns, and page templates. Use when analyzing any frontend repo (React/Vue/Angular/Next/Vite/etc.) to document or migrate UI/UX for reuse across projects. Focus on UI/UX only; explicitly ignore business logic and domain workflows.
