Debug TensorFlow and Keras issues systematically. This skill helps diagnose and resolve machine learning problems including tensor shape mismatches, GPU/CUDA detection failures, out-of-memory errors, NaN/Inf values in loss functions, vanishing/exploding gradients, SavedModel loading errors, and data pipeline bottlenecks. Provides tf.debugging assertions, TensorBoard profiling, eager execution debugging, and version compatibility guidance.
