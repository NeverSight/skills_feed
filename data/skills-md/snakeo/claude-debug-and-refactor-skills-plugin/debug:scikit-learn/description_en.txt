Debug Scikit-learn issues systematically. Use when encountering model errors like NotFittedError, shape mismatches between train and test data, NaN/infinity value errors, pipeline configuration issues, convergence warnings from optimizers, cross-validation failures due to class imbalance, data leakage causing suspiciously high scores, or preprocessing errors with ColumnTransformer and feature alignment.
