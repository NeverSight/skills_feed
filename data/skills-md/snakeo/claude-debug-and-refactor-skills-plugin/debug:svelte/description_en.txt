Debug Svelte application issues systematically. This skill helps diagnose and resolve Svelte-specific problems including reactivity failures, runes issues ($state, $derived, $effect), store subscription memory leaks, SSR hydration mismatches, and compiler warnings. Covers both Svelte 4 legacy patterns and Svelte 5 runes-based reactivity. Provides debugging tools like $inspect(), {@debug} tags, and svelte-check CLI usage.
