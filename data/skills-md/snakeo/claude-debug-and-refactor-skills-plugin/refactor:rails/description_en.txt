Refactor Ruby on Rails code to improve maintainability, readability, and adherence to best practices. This skill transforms messy Rails code into elegant, well-structured solutions following Rails conventions and modern Ruby best practices. It addresses fat controllers and models, extracts business logic into service objects, applies DRY principles, uses concerns for shared behavior, implements query objects for complex database operations, and leverages Rails 8 and Ruby 3.3+ features including pattern matching and Data classes.
