Refactor Kubernetes configurations to improve security, reliability, and maintainability. This skill applies defense-in-depth security principles, proper resource constraints, and GitOps patterns using Kustomize or Helm. It addresses containers running as root, missing health probes, hardcoded configs, and duplicate YAML across environments. Apply when you notice security vulnerabilities, missing Pod Disruption Budgets, or :latest image tags in production.
