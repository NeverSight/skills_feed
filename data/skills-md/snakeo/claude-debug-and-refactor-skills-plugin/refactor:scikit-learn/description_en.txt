Refactor Scikit-learn and machine learning code to improve maintainability, reproducibility, and adherence to best practices. This skill transforms working ML code into production-ready pipelines that prevent data leakage and ensure reproducible results. It addresses preprocessing outside pipelines, missing random_state parameters, improper cross-validation, and custom transformers not following sklearn API conventions. Implements proper Pipeline and ColumnTransformer patterns, systematic hyperparameter tuning, and appropriate evaluation metrics.
