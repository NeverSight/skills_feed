Refactor PHP/Laravel code to improve maintainability, readability, and adherence to best practices. This skill transforms code using modern PHP 8.3+/8.4+ features like property hooks and typed constants, Laravel 11+ patterns including Actions and simplified structure, and SOLID principles. It addresses fat controllers, code duplication, N+1 queries, and missing type declarations. Apply when you notice business logic in controllers or legacy PHP patterns.
