Refactor Flutter/Dart code to improve maintainability, readability, and performance. This skill applies Dart 3 features like records, patterns, and sealed classes, implements proper state management with Riverpod or BLoC, and uses Freezed for immutable models. It addresses monolithic widgets, missing const constructors, improper BuildContext usage, and deep nesting. Apply when you notice widgets doing too much, performance issues from unnecessary rebuilds, or legacy Dart 2 patterns.
