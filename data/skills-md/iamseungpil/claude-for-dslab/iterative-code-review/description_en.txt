Iteratively improve code quality by using task-planner-analyzer for planning, modular-code-architect agent to fix issues, code-reviewer agent to validate quality, and running tests to verify correctness. Use when implementing new features, after bug fixes, during refactoring, or when preparing code for production deployment. Loops until code-reviewer reports no critical issues AND tests pass.
