REST API for cross-chain and same-chain token swaps, bridging, and DeFi operations.

USE THIS SKILL WHEN USER WANTS TO:
- Swap tokens between different blockchains (e.g., "swap USDC on Ethereum to ETH on Arbitrum")
- Bridge tokens to another chain (e.g., "move my ETH from mainnet to Optimism")
- Swap tokens on the same chain with best rates (e.g., "swap ETH to USDC on Polygon")
- Find the best route or quote for a token swap across chains
- Execute DeFi operations across chains (zap, bridge+swap+deposit, yield farming entry)
- Build multi-chain payment flows (accept any token, settle in specific token)
- Check supported chains, tokens, or bridges for cross-chain transfers
- Track status of a cross-chain transaction
- Build backend services (Python, Go, Rust, etc.) that need cross-chain swaps
- Integrate cross-chain functionality via HTTP/REST (not JavaScript SDK)
