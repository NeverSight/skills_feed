TypeScript/JavaScript SDK for cross-chain and same-chain token swaps, bridging, and DeFi operations.

USE THIS SKILL TO:
- Swap tokens between different blockchains (e.g., "swap USDC on Ethereum to ETH on Arbitrum")
- Bridge tokens to another chain (e.g., "transfer my ETH from mainnet to Base")
- Swap tokens on the same chain with best DEX rates (e.g., "swap ETH to DAI on Polygon")
- Get quotes or compare routes for token swaps across any chains
- Execute 1-click DeFi workflows (zap into LP, bridge+swap+deposit, cross-chain yield entry)
- Build a dApp, wallet, or frontend that supports multi-chain token operations
- Create payment flows that accept any token and convert to a specific token
- Build React, Next.js, Vue, or Node.js apps with cross-chain swap functionality
- Handle cross-chain transaction lifecycle (status tracking, retries, refunds)
- Find available bridges, DEXs, chains, or tokens for cross-chain operations
