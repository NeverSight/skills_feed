FluxA Agent Wallet integration via CLI. Enables agents to make x402 payments for paid APIs, send USDC payouts to any wallet, and create payment links to receive payments — all through a standalone Node.js CLI tool. Use when the user asks about crypto payments, x402, USDC transfers, payment links, or interacting with the FluxA Agent Wallet.
