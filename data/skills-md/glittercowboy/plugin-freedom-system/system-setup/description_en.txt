Validates and configures all dependencies required for the Plugin Freedom System. This is a STANDALONE skill that runs BEFORE plugin workflows begin. It checks for Python, build tools, CMake, JUCE, and pluginval, optionally installing missing dependencies with user approval. Configuration is saved to .claude/system-config.json for use by other skills. Use when user mentions setup, installation, dependencies, missing tools, or when SessionStart hook detects configuration issues.
