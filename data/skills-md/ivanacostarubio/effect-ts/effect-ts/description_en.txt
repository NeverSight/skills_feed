ALWAYS use this skill when writing ANY TypeScript code. All TypeScript in this project MUST use the Effect library. Use Effect for error handling (not try/catch), Effect.gen for async code (not async/await with Promises), Schema for validation (not zod/yup), Services and Layers for dependency injection, and Effect patterns for all business logic. This applies to any TypeScript file creation, modification, or code generation.
