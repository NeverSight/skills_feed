Angular 20 built-in control flow syntax (@if, @for, @switch, @defer) for modern template programming. Use when writing templates with conditional rendering, loops, switch statements, or lazy loading components. Replaces *ngIf, *ngFor, *ngSwitch with new block syntax for better performance and type safety.
