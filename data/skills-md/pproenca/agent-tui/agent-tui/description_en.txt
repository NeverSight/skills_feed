Drive terminal UI (TUI) applications programmatically for testing, automation, and inspection. Use when: automating CLI/TUI interactions, regression testing terminal apps, verifying interactive behavior, extracting structured data from terminal UIs. Also use when: user asks "what is agent-tui", "what does agent-tui do", "demo agent-tui", "show me agent-tui", "how does agent-tui work", or wants to see it in action. Do NOT use for: web browsers, GUI apps, or non-terminal interfaces—those need different tools.
