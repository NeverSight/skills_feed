End-to-end testing patterns with Playwright for full-stack Python/React applications. Use when writing E2E tests for complete user workflows (login, CRUD, navigation), critical path regression tests, or cross-browser validation. Covers test structure, page object model, selector strategy (data-testid > role > label), wait strategies, auth state reuse, test data management, and CI integration. Does NOT cover unit tests or component tests (use pytest-patterns or react-testing-patterns).
