Decompose high-level objectives into atomic implementation tasks for Python/React projects. Use when breaking down large features, multi-file changes, or tasks requiring more than 3 steps. Produces independently-verifiable tasks with done-conditions, file paths, complexity estimates, and explicit ordering. Creates persistent task files (task_plan.md, progress.md) to track state across context windows. Does NOT cover high-level planning (use project-planner) or architecture decisions (use system-architecture).
