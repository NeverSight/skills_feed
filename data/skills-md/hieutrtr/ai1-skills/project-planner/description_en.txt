Project planning and feature breakdown for Python/React full-stack projects. Use during the planning phase when breaking down feature requests, user stories, or product requirements into implementation plans. Guides identification of affected files and modules, defines acceptance criteria, assesses risks, and estimates overall complexity. Produces module maps, risk assessments, and acceptance criteria. Does NOT cover architecture decisions (use system-architecture), implementation (use python-backend-expert or react-frontend-expert), or atomic task decomposition (use task-decomposition).
