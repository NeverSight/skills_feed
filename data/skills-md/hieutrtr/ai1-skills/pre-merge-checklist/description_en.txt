Comprehensive pre-merge validation checklist for Python/React pull requests. Use before approving or merging any PR. Covers code quality checks (linting, formatting, type checking), test coverage requirements, documentation updates, migration safety, API contract compatibility, accessibility compliance, bundle size impact, and deployment readiness. Provides a systematic checklist that ensures nothing is missed before merge. Does NOT cover security review depth (use code-review-security).
