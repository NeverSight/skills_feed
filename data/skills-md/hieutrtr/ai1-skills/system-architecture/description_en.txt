System architecture guidance for Python/React full-stack projects. Use during the design phase when making architectural decisions — component boundaries, service layer design, data flow patterns, database schema planning, and technology trade-off analysis. Covers FastAPI layer architecture (Routes/Services/Repositories/Models), React component hierarchy, state management, and cross-cutting concerns (auth, errors, logging). Produces architecture documents and ADRs. Does NOT cover implementation (use python-backend-expert or react-frontend-expert) or API contract design (use api-design-patterns).
