FastAPI framework mechanics and advanced patterns. Use when configuring middleware, creating dependency injection chains, implementing WebSocket endpoints, customizing OpenAPI documentation, setting up CORS, building authentication dependencies (JWT validation, role-based access), implementing background tasks, or managing application lifespan (startup/shutdown). Does NOT cover basic endpoint CRUD or repository/service patterns (use python-backend-expert) or testing (use pytest-patterns).
