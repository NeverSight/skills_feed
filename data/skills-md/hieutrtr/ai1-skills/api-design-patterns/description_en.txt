API contract design conventions for FastAPI projects with Pydantic v2. Use during the design phase when planning new API endpoints, defining request/response contracts, designing pagination or filtering, standardizing error responses, or planning API versioning. Covers RESTful naming, HTTP method semantics, Pydantic v2 schema naming conventions (XxxCreate/XxxUpdate/XxxResponse), cursor-based pagination, standard error format, and OpenAPI documentation. Does NOT cover implementation details (use python-backend-expert) or system-level architecture (use system-architecture).
