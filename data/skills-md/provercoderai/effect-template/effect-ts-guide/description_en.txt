Teach and apply Effect-TS practices (effect, @effect/schema, @effect/platform) for architecture, typed errors, Layers, dependency injection, resource safety, testing, and migration from async/await/Promise. Use when a user asks how to use Effect, requests best practices, wants to refactor to Effect, or needs mapping from platform modules to Node/Bun/Browser APIs.
