Uses the uv Python package and project manager correctly for dependencies, venvs, and scripts. Use when creating or modifying Python projects, adding dependencies, running scripts with inline deps, managing virtual environments, pinning Python versions, running CLI tools from PyPI, setting the IDE Python interpreter, or using uv in CI (e.g. GitHub Actions) or Docker containers. Use when the user mentions uv, pyproject.toml, uv.lock, uv run, uv add, uv sync, .venv, Python interpreter, poetry, pipenv, conda, CI, Docker, GitHub Actions, or asks to use uv instead of pip or poetry.
