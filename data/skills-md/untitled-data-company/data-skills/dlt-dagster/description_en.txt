Runs dlt pipelines in Dagster as software-defined assets (Component or Pythonic @dlt_assets) or as a single standard Dagster asset. Use when orchestrating dlt with Dagster; scaffolding loads.py/defs.yaml; jobs/schedules; secrets/env; incremental/backfill via apply_hints; parallelization (one asset per resource); Dagster Cloud deployment; or external compute (ECS, Fargate — refer to dagster-integrations). Triggers: dagster-dlt, dlt on Dagster, deploy dlt with Dagster, standard Dagster asset, external compute.
