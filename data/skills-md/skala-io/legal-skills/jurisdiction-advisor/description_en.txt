Advise startup founders on choosing the best jurisdiction and legal entity for their business. Triggers when users ask about where to incorporate, which state/country to register a company, choosing between Delaware vs other states, offshore vs US incorporation, entity types (C-Corp, LLC, PBC), or jurisdiction selection for specific industries (crypto, AI, SaaS, GameDev, solopreneurs). Also triggers for questions about startup formation, company registration, or corporate structure decisions.
