Manage Jira tickets from the command line using jira-cli. Contains essential setup instructions, non-interactive command patterns with required flags (--plain, --raw, etc.), authentication troubleshooting, and comprehensive command reference. This skill is triggered when the user says things like "create a Jira ticket", "list my Jira issues", "update Jira issue", "move Jira ticket to done", "log time in Jira", "add comment to Jira", or "search Jira issues". IMPORTANT - Read this skill before running any jira-cli commands to avoid blocking in interactive mode.
