Convert audio files to text using parakeet-mlx, NVIDIA's Parakeet automatic speech recognition model optimized for Apple's MLX framework. Run via uvx for on-device speech-to-text processing with high-quality timestamped transcriptions. Ideal for podcasts, interviews, meetings, and other audio content. This skill is triggered when the user says things like "transcribe this audio", "convert audio to text", "transcribe this podcast", "get text from this recording", "speech to text", or "transcribe this wav/mp3/m4a file".
