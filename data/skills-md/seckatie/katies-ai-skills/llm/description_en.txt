Access and interact with Large Language Models from the command line using Simon Willison's llm CLI tool. Supports OpenAI, Anthropic, Gemini, Llama, and dozens of other models via plugins. Features include chat sessions, embeddings, structured data extraction with schemas, prompt templates, conversation logging, and tool use. This skill is triggered when the user says things like "run a prompt with llm", "use the llm command", "call an LLM from the command line", "set up llm API keys", "install llm plugins", "create embeddings", or "extract structured data from text".
