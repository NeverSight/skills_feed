Build and maintain SQLAdmin admin interfaces for SQLAlchemy models in FastAPI or Starlette apps. Use when you need to add an admin UI, configure ModelView behavior (lists, forms, filters, exports), add authentication/authorization or role-based permissions, customize templates, add custom views/actions, integrate file/image uploads, or set up async SQLAlchemy engines/sessions.
