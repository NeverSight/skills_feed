Use when you need to choose the right visualization for your data and question, then create a narrated report that highlights insights and recommends actions. Invoke when analyzing data for patterns (trends, comparisons, distributions, relationships, compositions), building dashboards or reports, presenting metrics to stakeholders, monitoring KPIs, exploring datasets for insights, communicating findings from analysis, or when user mentions "visualize this", "what chart should I use", "create a dashboard", "analyze this data", "show trends", "compare these metrics", "report on", "what does this data tell us", or needs to turn data into actionable insights. Apply to business analytics (revenue, growth, churn, funnel, cohort, segmentation), product metrics (usage, adoption, retention, feature performance, A/B tests), marketing analytics (campaign ROI, attribution, funnel, customer acquisition), financial reporting (P&L, budget, forecast, variance), operational metrics (uptime, performance, capacity, SLA), sales analytics (pipeline, forecast, territory, quota attainment), HR metrics (headcount, turnover, engagement, DEI), and any scenario where data needs to become a clear, actionable story with the right visual form.
