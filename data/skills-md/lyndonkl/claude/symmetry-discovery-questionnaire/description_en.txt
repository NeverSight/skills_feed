Use when ML engineers need to identify symmetries in their data but don't know where to start. Invoke when user mentions data symmetry, invariance discovery, what transformations matter, or needs help recognizing patterns their model should respect. Works collaboratively through domain analysis, transformation testing, and physical constraint identification.
