Use when making quick order-of-magnitude estimates under uncertainty (market sizing, resource planning, feasibility checks), decomposing complex quantities into estimable parts, bounding unknowns with upper/lower limits, sanity-checking strategic assumptions, or when user mentions Fermi estimation, back-of-envelope calculation, order of magnitude, ballpark estimate, triangulation, or needs to assess feasibility before detailed analysis.
