Use when facing decisions with multiple legitimate perspectives and inherent tensions. Invoke when stakeholders have competing priorities (growth vs. sustainability, speed vs. quality, innovation vs. risk), need to pressure-test ideas from different angles before committing, exploring tradeoffs between incompatible values, synthesizing conflicting expert opinions into coherent strategy, or surfacing assumptions that single-viewpoint analysis would miss.
