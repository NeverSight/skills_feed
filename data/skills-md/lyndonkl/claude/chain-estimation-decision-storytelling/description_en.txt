Use when making high-stakes decisions under uncertainty that require stakeholder buy-in. Invoke when evaluating strategic options (build vs buy, market entry, resource allocation), quantifying tradeoffs with uncertain outcomes, justifying investments with expected value analysis, pitching recommendations to decision-makers, or creating business cases with cost-benefit estimates. Use when user mentions "should we", "ROI analysis", "make a case for", "evaluate options", "expected value", "justify decision", or needs to combine estimation, decision analysis, and persuasive communication.
