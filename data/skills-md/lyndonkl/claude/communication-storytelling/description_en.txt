Use when transforming analysis/data into persuasive narratives—presenting to executives, explaining technical concepts to non-technical audiences, creating customer-facing communications, writing investor updates, announcing changes, turning research into insights, or when user mentions "write this for", "explain to", "present findings", "make this compelling", "audience is". Invoke when information needs to become a story tailored to specific stakeholders.
