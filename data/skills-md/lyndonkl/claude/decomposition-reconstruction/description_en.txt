Use when dealing with complex systems that need simplification, identifying bottlenecks or critical failure points, redesigning architecture or processes for better performance, breaking down problems that feel overwhelming, analyzing dependencies to understand ripple effects, user mentions "this is too complex", "where's the bottleneck", "how do we redesign this", "what are the key components", or when optimization requires understanding how parts interact.
