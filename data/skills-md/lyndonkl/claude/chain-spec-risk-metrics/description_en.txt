Use when planning high-stakes initiatives (migrations, launches, strategic changes) that require clear specifications, proactive risk identification (premortem/register), and measurable success criteria. Invoke when user mentions "plan this migration", "launch strategy", "implementation roadmap", "what could go wrong", "how do we measure success", or when high-impact decisions need comprehensive planning with risk mitigation and instrumentation.
