Use when you've identified candidate symmetries and need to map them to mathematical groups for architecture design. Invoke when user mentions cyclic groups, dihedral groups, Lie groups, SO(3), SE(3), permutation groups, or needs to formalize symmetries into group theory language. Provides taxonomy and mathematical foundations from Visual Group Theory principles.
