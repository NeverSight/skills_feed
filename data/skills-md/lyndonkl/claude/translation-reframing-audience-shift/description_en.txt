Use when content must be translated between audiences with different expertise, context, or goals while preserving accuracy but adapting presentation. Invoke when technical content needs business framing (engineering decisions → executive summary), strategic vision needs tactical translation (board presentation → team OKRs), expert knowledge needs simplification (academic paper → blog post, medical diagnosis → patient explanation), formal content needs casual tone (annual report → social media post), long-form needs summarization (50-page doc → 1-page brief), internal content needs external framing (roadmap → public updates, bug tracking → known issues), cross-cultural adaptation (US idioms → international clarity, Gen Z → Boomer messaging), medium shifts (written report → presentation script, detailed spec → action checklist), or when user mentions "explain to", "reframe for", "translate this for [audience]", "make this more [accessible/formal/technical]", "adapt for [executives/engineers/customers]", "simplify without losing accuracy", or "same content, different audience". Apply to technical communication (code → business value), organizational translation (strategy → execution), education (expert → novice), customer communication (internal → external), cross-cultural messaging, and anywhere same core message needs different presentation for different stakeholders while maintaining correctness.
