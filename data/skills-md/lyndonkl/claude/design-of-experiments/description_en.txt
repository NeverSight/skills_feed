Use when optimizing multi-factor systems with limited experimental budget, screening many variables to find the vital few, discovering interactions between parameters, mapping response surfaces for peak performance, validating robustness to noise factors, or when users mention factorial designs, A/B/n testing, parameter tuning, process optimization, or experimental efficiency.
