Use when synthesizing information from multiple sources (literature review, stakeholder feedback, research findings, data from different systems), creating or evaluating analogies for explanation or problem-solving (cross-domain transfer, "X is like Y", structural mapping), combining conflicting viewpoints into unified framework, identifying patterns across disparate sources, finding creative solutions by transferring principles from one domain to another, testing whether analogies hold (surface vs deep similarities), or when user mentions "synthesize", "combine sources", "analogy", "like", "similar to", "transfer from", "integrate findings", "what's it analogous to".
