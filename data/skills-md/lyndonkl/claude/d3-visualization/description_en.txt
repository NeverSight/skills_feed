Use when creating custom, interactive data visualizations with D3.js—building bar/line/scatter charts from scratch, creating network diagrams or geographic maps, binding changing data to visual elements, adding zoom/pan/brush interactions, animating chart transitions, or when chart libraries (Highcharts, Chart.js) don't support your specific visualization design and you need low-level control over data-driven DOM manipulation, scales, shapes, and layouts.
