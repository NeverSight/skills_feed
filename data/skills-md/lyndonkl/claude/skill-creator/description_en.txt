Use when the user has a document (PDF, markdown, book notes, research paper, methodology guide) containing theoretical knowledge or frameworks and wants to convert it into an actionable, reusable skill. Invoke when the user mentions "create a skill from this document", "turn this into a skill", "extract a skill from this file", or when analyzing documents with methodologies, frameworks, processes, or systematic approaches that could be made actionable for future use.
