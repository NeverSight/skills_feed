Use when testing ideas cheaply before building (pretotyping with fake doors, concierge MVPs, paper prototypes) to validate desirability/feasibility, choosing appropriate prototype fidelity (paper/clickable/coded), running experiments to test assumptions (demand, pricing, workflow), or when user mentions prototype, MVP, fake door test, concierge, Wizard of Oz, landing page test, smoke test, or asks "how can we validate this idea before building?".
