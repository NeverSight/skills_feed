Use when you have validated symmetry groups and need to design neural network architecture that respects those symmetries. Invoke when user mentions equivariant layers, G-CNN, e3nn, steerable networks, building symmetry into model, or needs architecture recommendations for specific symmetry groups. Provides architecture patterns and implementation guidance.
