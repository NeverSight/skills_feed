Scaffold modern iOS apps and features with Clean Architecture, MVVM, SwiftUI, GRDB, Swift Concurrency, optional Apple Foundation Models integration, and modular local packages. Use when creating a new iOS app, adding a feature/service/model/migration/design system component/package, or enforcing Domain/Data/Presentation separation with feature-local ownership by default and shared modules only for true cross-domain concerns.
