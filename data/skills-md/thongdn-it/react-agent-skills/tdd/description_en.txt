Test-Driven Development methodology and red-green-refactor workflow (formerly test-tdd). This skill should be used when practicing TDD, writing tests first, designing tests before implementation, or reviewing test-first approaches. Triggers on "write tests first", "test before code", "red green refactor", "test driven development". This skill does NOT cover Vitest framework specifics (use vitest skill) or API mocking with MSW (use msw skill).
