Structured approach for building features through iterative spec documents. Use when (1) starting a new feature from a rough idea, (2) needing to create requirements, design, or implementation plans, (3) wanting to break down complex features into manageable coding tasks, (4) executing or implementing tasks from an existing spec, (5) the user mentions "spec", "requirements", "design document", "implementation plan", or "run task". Creates and manages .agent/specs/{feature-name}/.
