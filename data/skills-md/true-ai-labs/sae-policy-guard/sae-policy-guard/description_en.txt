Pre-trade risk assessment and policy enforcement for crypto trading using the Survivability-Aware Execution (SAE) framework. Use this skill before executing any crypto trade, when evaluating trader behavioral state (revenge trading, tilt, overconfidence, late-night impulsivity), when assessing market narrative risk, when computing position/leverage/frequency limits, when enforcing cool-down periods or staged execution, when auditing trading plugins or extensions for supply-chain risk, or when the user mentions risk management, survivability, blow-up prevention, liquidation avoidance, or trading discipline.
