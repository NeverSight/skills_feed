Build, develop, and deploy Power Apps Code Apps — code-first web applications that run inside the Power Platform. Use this skill when working on Power Apps Code Apps projects: scaffolding new apps, writing React components that use the @microsoft/power-apps SDK, adding data sources and connectors (Dataverse, SQL, SharePoint, Office 365), using generated CRUD services and typed models, running pac CLI commands (pac code init, pac code push, pac code add-data-source), configuring Vite builds with the power-apps-vite plugin, or deploying to Power Platform environments. Triggers on: power.config.json files, @microsoft/power-apps imports, pac code commands, Power Apps Code Apps projects.
