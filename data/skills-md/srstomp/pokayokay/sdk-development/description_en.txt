Create, extract, and publish TypeScript SDKs. Covers analyzing existing applications to extract reusable logic, designing clean SDK APIs, implementing typed clients with proper error handling, bundling for multiple targets (ESM/CJS/browser), and publishing to npm (public or private registries). Use this skill when building SDKs, extracting shared code into packages, or creating developer tooling libraries.
