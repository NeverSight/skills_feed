Generate professional advertising images from product URLs using the Ad-Ready pipeline on ComfyDeploy. Use when the user wants to create ads for any product by providing a URL, optionally with a brand profile (70+ brands) and funnel stage targeting. Supports model/talent integration, brand-aware creative direction, and multi-format output. Differs from Morpheus (manual fashion photography) — Ad-Ready is URL-driven, brand-intelligent, and funnel-stage aware.
