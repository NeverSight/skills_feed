Build applications with InsForge Backend-as-a-Service. Use when developers need to:
(1) Set up backend infrastructure (create tables, storage buckets, deploy functions, configure auth/AI)
(2) Integrate InsForge SDK into frontend applications (database CRUD, auth flows, file uploads, AI operations, real-time messaging)
(3) Deploy frontend applications to InsForge hosting

IMPORTANT: Before any backend work, you MUST have the user's Project URL and API Key. If not provided, ask the user first.

Key distinction: Backend configuration uses HTTP API calls to the InsForge project URL. Client integration uses the @insforge/sdk in application code.
