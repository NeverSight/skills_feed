Apple HIG guidance for system experience components: widgets, live activities, notifications, complications, home screen quick actions, top shelf, watch faces, app clips, and app shortcuts. Use when asked about: "widget design", "live activity", "notification design", "complication", "home screen quick action", "top shelf", "watch face", "app clip", "app shortcut", "system experience". Also use when the user says "how do I design a widget," "what should my notification look like," "how do Live Activities work," "should I make an App Clip," or asks about surfaces outside the main app. Cross-references: hig-components-status for progress in widgets, hig-inputs for interaction patterns, hig-technologies for Siri and system integration.
