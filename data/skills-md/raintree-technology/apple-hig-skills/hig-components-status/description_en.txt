Apple HIG guidance for status and progress UI components including progress indicators, status bars, and activity rings. Use this skill when asked about: "progress indicator", "progress bar", "loading spinner", "status bar", "activity ring", "progress display", determinate vs indeterminate progress, loading states, or fitness tracking rings. Also use when the user says "how do I show loading state," "should I use a spinner or progress bar," "what goes in the status bar," or asks about activity indicators. Cross-references: hig-components-system for widgets and complications, hig-inputs for gesture-driven progress controls, hig-technologies for HealthKit and activity ring data integration.
