Apple Human Interface Guidelines for content display components. Use this skill when the user asks about "charts component", "collection view", "image view", "web view", "color well", "image well", "activity view", "lockup", "data visualization", "content display", displaying images, rendering web content, color pickers, or presenting collections of items in Apple apps. Also use when the user says "how should I display charts", "what's the best way to show images", "should I use a web view", "how do I build a grid of items", "what component shows media", or "how do I present a share sheet". Cross-references: hig-foundations for color/typography/accessibility, hig-patterns for data visualization patterns, hig-components-layout for structural containers, hig-platforms for platform-specific component behavior.
