Apple Human Interface Guidelines interaction and UX patterns. Use this skill when the user asks about "onboarding flow", "user onboarding", "app launch", "loading state", "drag and drop", "search pattern", "settings design", "notifications", "modality", "multitasking", "feedback pattern", "haptics", "undo redo", "file management", data entry, sharing, collaboration, full screen, audio, video, haptic feedback, ratings, printing, help, or account management in Apple apps. Also use when the user says "how should onboarding work", "my app takes too long to load", "should I use a modal here", "how do I handle errors", "when should I ask for permissions", "how to show progress", or "what's the right way to confirm a delete".
