Apple HIG guidance for presentation components including alerts, action sheets, popovers, sheets, and digit entry views. Use this skill when the user says "should I use an alert or a sheet," "how do I show a confirmation dialog," "when should I use a popover," "my modals are annoying users," or asks about alert design, action sheet, popover, sheet, modal, dialog, digit entry, confirmation dialog, warning dialog, modal presentation, non-modal content, destructive action confirmation, or overlay UI patterns.
