Apple Human Interface Guidelines for layout and navigation components. Use this skill when the user asks about "sidebar", "split view", "tab bar", "tab view", "scroll view", "window design", "panel", "list view", "table view", "column view", "outline view", "navigation structure", "app layout", "boxes", "ornaments", or organizing content hierarchically in Apple apps. Also use when the user says "how should I organize my app", "what navigation pattern should I use", "my layout breaks on iPad", "how do I build a sidebar", "should I use tabs or a sidebar", or "my app doesn't adapt to different screen sizes". Cross-references: hig-foundations for layout/spacing principles, hig-platforms for platform-specific navigation, hig-patterns for multitasking and full-screen, hig-components-content for content display.
