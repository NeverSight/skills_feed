Create or update a shared Apple design context document that other HIG skills use to tailor guidance. Use when the user says "set up my project context," "what platforms am I targeting," "configure HIG settings," or when starting a new Apple platform project. Also activates when other HIG skills need project context but none exists yet. This skill creates .claude/apple-design-context.md so that hig-foundations, hig-platforms, hig-components-*, hig-inputs, and hig-technologies can provide targeted advice without repetitive questions.
