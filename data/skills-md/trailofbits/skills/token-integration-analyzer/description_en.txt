Token integration and implementation analyzer based on Trail of Bits' token integration checklist. Analyzes token implementations for ERC20/ERC721 conformity, checks for 20+ weird token patterns, assesses contract composition and owner privileges, performs on-chain scarcity analysis, and evaluates how protocols handle non-standard tokens. Context-aware for both token implementations and token integrations.
