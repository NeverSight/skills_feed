Create or update root and nested AGENTS.md files that document scoped conventions, monorepo module maps, cross-domain workflows, and (optionally) per-module feature maps (feature -> paths, entrypoints, tests, docs). Use when the user asks for AGENTS.md, nested agent instructions, or a module/feature map.
