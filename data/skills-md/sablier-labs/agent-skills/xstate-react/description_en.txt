This skill should be used when the user asks to "create a state machine", "add xState", "use xState with React", "implement actor-based state", "manage complex state with state machines", "use xState with Effect", "integrate Effect-ts with xState", mentions xState hooks (useMachine, useActor, useSelector), or discusses finite state machines in React applications.
