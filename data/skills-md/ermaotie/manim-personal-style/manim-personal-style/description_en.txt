Plan and implement Manim Community (ManimCE) animations: use when users want 3Blue1Brown-style explainer videos, need scene-by-scene planning, or ask for ManimCE code/visualizations. Must gather requirements, produce a scenes.md plan before any Manim code, then implement with ManimCE best practices using the provided rules, examples, and templates.
