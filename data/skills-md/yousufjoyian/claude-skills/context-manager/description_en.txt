Maintain compiled context artifacts for stateless agent spawning. This skill produces BOOT_CONTEXT (stable project brain), DELTA_CONTEXT (recent changes), and feature bundles so any agent can spawn with deep understanding without reading the entire repo. Use this skill when setting up multi-agent workflows or when agents need fast, token-efficient onboarding.
