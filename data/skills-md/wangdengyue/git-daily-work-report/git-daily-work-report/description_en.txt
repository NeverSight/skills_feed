Automatically generate daily work reports by scanning Git repositories. Use this skill when the user asks to: (1) Generate a daily report from git commits, (2) Summarize work done on a specific date based on code changes, (3) Check commits and create work summary for a date. The skill scans all git repositories under a root directory, filters by author, retrieves commit records with file changes, and generates a summarized work content description using LLM analysis.
