Write minimal, helpful code comments that explain why rather than what, prioritizing self-documenting code with clear structure and naming. Use this skill when adding comments to code, documenting complex logic, explaining non-obvious decisions or algorithms, writing function or class documentation, creating inline explanations for large sections of code, removing outdated or unhelpful comments, refactoring code to be more self-explanatory, or ensuring comments remain evergreen and relevant long-term. Use across all programming languages when deciding whether and how to comment code, including when writing or reviewing .js, .ts, .py, .java, .go, .rs, .rb, .php, .jsx, .tsx, .vue files or any other code files.
