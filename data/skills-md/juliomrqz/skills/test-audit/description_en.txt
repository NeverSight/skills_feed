Audit test suites (unit, integration, feature/E2E) for correctness, quality, and best practices. Use when the user wants to review, audit, validate, or improve tests in any programming language or framework (Jest, pytest, RSpec, JUnit, PHPUnit, etc.). Triggers on requests like "audit my tests", "review test quality", "check my test coverage", "are my tests good", or any request to evaluate test effectiveness.
