Coordinate agents via the AMQ CLI for file-based inter-agent messaging. Use when you need to send messages to another agent (Claude/Codex), receive messages from partner agents, set up co-op mode between Claude Code and Codex CLI, or manage agent-to-agent communication in any multi-agent workflow. Triggers include "message codex", "talk to claude", "collaborate with partner agent", "AMQ", "inter-agent messaging", or "agent coordination".
