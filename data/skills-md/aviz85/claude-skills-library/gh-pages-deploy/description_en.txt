Deploy static or interactive frontend content to GitHub Pages using gh CLI. Use when the user wants to publish, share, or make accessible any HTML/CSS/JS content - including demos, prototypes, visualizations, landing pages, portfolios, documentation, interactive tools, games, or any browser-based project. Activate whenever content needs to be publicly viewable via URL, not just when "website" is explicitly mentioned.
