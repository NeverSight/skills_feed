Teach Claude ANY topic - code libraries, APIs, concepts, tools, methodologies, or domains. Researches via web and docs, then retains knowledge as a permanent skill. Use when user says "/learn <topic>", "learn about X", "teach yourself Y", "become an expert on Z". Examples - "/learn stripe" for payments, "/learn GTD" for productivity, "/learn israeli-tax-law" for domain knowledge.
