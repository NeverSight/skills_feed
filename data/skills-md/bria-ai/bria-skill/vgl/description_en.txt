Write structured VGL (Visual Generation Language) JSON prompts for Bria's FIBO image generation models. Use this skill when creating detailed image descriptions in JSON format for text-to-image generation, image editing, inpainting, outpainting, background generation, or captioning. Triggers include requests to write structured prompts, create VGL JSON, describe images for AI generation, or work with Bria/FIBO's structured_prompt format. Also use when converting natural language image requests into the deterministic JSON schema required by FIBO models.
