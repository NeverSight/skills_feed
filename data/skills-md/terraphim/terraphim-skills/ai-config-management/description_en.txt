Produce formal specifications for AI-enabled Configuration Management (CM) systems that operationalise Context Engineering principles. Use when tasked with: (1) creating CM specifications for AI-enabled programs, (2) defining semantic governance models for AI artefacts, (3) designing drift detection frameworks for prompts/models/domains, (4) specifying stage-gate control logic with semantic validation, (5) building traceability models across AI lifecycle stages, (6) defining change control for prompt and model evolution, (7) architecting AI agent roles for configuration governance, or (8) any configuration control task involving probabilistic AI behaviour, evolving prompts, shifting domain definitions, or artefact proliferation.
