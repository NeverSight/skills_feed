Phase 1.5/2.5 of disciplined development. Evaluates document quality using the
KLS (Krogstie-Lindland-Sindre) 6-dimension framework. Produces structured ratings,
identifies gaps, suggests specific revisions, and blocks phase transitions when
quality is below threshold. Applies to Phase 1 research docs and Phase 2 design docs.
