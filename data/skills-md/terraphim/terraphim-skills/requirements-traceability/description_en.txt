Create or audit requirements-to-design-to-code-to-test traceability. Builds a
traceability matrix (REQ → design/ADR → implementation files → tests →
evidence) and flags gaps (unimplemented requirements, untested changes,
undocumented decisions). Use when you need a requirements traceability check
for a PR/release, regulated/compliance work, or when requirements are drifting
from implementation.
