Design and implement visual regression testing for UI changes. Defines
screenshot coverage, rendering stabilization, baseline management, and CI
integration (e.g., Playwright screenshots, Percy/Chromatic). Use when
UI/styling/layout changes need protection against regressions, or when adding
screenshot-based tests to a web/WASM/desktop UI.
