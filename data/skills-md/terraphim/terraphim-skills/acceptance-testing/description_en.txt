Plan and (when feasible) implement or execute user acceptance tests (UAT) /
end-to-end acceptance scenarios. Converts requirements or user stories into
acceptance criteria, test cases, test data, and a sign-off checklist; suggests
automation (Playwright/Cypress for web, golden/snapshot tests for CLIs/APIs).
Use when validating user-visible behavior for a release, or mapping
requirements to acceptance coverage.
