Guide for building sandbox applications with ComputeSDK, a unified TypeScript SDK for running untrusted code in sandboxed environments across multiple compute providers (E2B, Daytona, Vercel, Modal, Railway, Namespace, Render). Use this skill when implementing sandboxed code execution, creating isolated development environments, running LLM-generated code safely, building app builders, or integrating dynamic code execution into applications.
