Configure and troubleshoot Cloudflare DNS records and Pages custom-domain bindings. Use when a user asks to add/edit/delete DNS records, map a custom domain to Cloudflare Pages/Workers, verify propagation, or fix domain validation errors. On first use, prompt for API token setup with DNS edit permissions before making changes.
