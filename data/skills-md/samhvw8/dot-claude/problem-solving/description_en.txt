Systematic problem-solving techniques for stuck-ness. Techniques: simplification cascade (complexity spirals), collision-zone thinking (innovation blocks), meta-pattern recognition (recurring issues), inversion exercise (assumption constraints), scale game (uncertainty). Actions: simplify, analyze, recognize patterns, invert assumptions, scale thinking. Keywords: problem solving, complexity spiral, innovation block, stuck, simplification, meta-pattern, assumption inversion, scale uncertainty, breakthrough thinking, root cause, systematic analysis, Microsoft Amplifier, debugging approach, creative solution. Use when: complexity spiraling, hitting innovation blocks, seeing recurring patterns, constrained by assumptions, uncertain about scale, generally stuck on problems.
