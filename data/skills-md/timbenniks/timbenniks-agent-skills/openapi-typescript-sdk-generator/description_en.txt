Generate a production TypeScript SDK from an OpenAPI 3.0/3.1 spec (URL or local file), with human-friendly method names, interactive confirmation, and deterministic output. Use when the user wants a type-safe, fetch-based SDK or a drop-in client. Do not use for streaming/SSE/WebSockets or interactive OAuth flows.
