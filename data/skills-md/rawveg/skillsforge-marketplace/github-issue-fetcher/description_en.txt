This skill should be used when users need to fetch GitHub issues from the current repository, including getting the next issue to work on, retrieving specific issue fields (body, number, title, labels, etc.), or querying issues with custom sorting and filtering. Triggers on requests like "get the next GitHub issue", "what's the next issue number", "show me the issue body", or "find issues with label X".
