This skill processes files containing figlet tags and replaces them with ASCII art representations. It detects and preserves comment styles (forward slash forward slash, hash, double-dash, forward slash asterisk), automatically manages Node.js dependencies, and supports 400+ fonts (defaulting to the standard font). The skill should be used when a user requests converting marked text in a file to ASCII art using figlet tag syntax, or when they want to list available fonts.
