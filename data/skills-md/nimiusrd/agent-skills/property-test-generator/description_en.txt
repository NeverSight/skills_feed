Design and generate property-based tests (PBT) for changed files in the current git branch. Extracts specifications, designs properties (invariants, round-trip, idempotence, metamorphic, monotonicity, reference model), builds generator strategies, implements tests, and self-scores against a rubric (24/30+ required). Supports fast-check (TS/JS), hypothesis (Python), and proptest (Rust). Use when: (1) "write property tests for my changes", (2) "add PBT", (3) "property-based test", (4) after implementing pure functions, validators, parsers, or formatters to verify invariants.
