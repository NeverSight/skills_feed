Generate or update tests for changed files in the current git branch, using statement coverage as the evaluation metric (target: 80%+). Use when: (1) the user asks to "write tests for my changes", "add tests for the current branch", or "improve coverage", (2) after implementing a feature to ensure adequate test coverage, (3) before a PR to verify changed code is tested. Supports Vitest and Cargo projects. Invoked with /test-generator or phrases like "generate tests", "test my changes", "cover the diff".
