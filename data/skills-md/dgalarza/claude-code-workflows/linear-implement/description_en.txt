This skill should be used when implementing features from Linear issues with full TDD workflow, automated planning, parallel code reviews (security and Rails best practices), systematic feedback implementation, and automated PR creation with Linear integration. Use when the user provides a Linear issue ID (e.g., "TRA-9", "DEV-123") and wants a complete implementation workflow from issue to PR.
