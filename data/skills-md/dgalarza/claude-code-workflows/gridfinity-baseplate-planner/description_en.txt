Use this skill when planning and designing gridfinity baseplates for 3D printing. This includes calculating optimal grid sizes from given measurements, determining how to slice large grids into printable chunks based on printer bed dimensions, and calculating padding requirements for non-exact fits. The skill handles both metric and imperial measurements and provides guidance for using gridfinity.perplexinglabs.com to generate the actual STL files.
