Translate Figma nodes into production-ready code with 1:1 visual fidelity using the Figma MCP workflow (design context, screenshots, assets, and project-convention translation). Trigger when the user provides Figma URLs or node IDs, or asks to implement designs or components that must match Figma specs. Requires a working Figma MCP server connection.
