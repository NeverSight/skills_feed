Use when researching or implementing anything related to Apple platforms (iOS, iPadOS, macOS, watchOS, tvOS, visionOS), Swift/Objective-C APIs, Apple frameworks, WWDC sessions, or Apple Developer Documentation. Triggers include: "find Apple's docs", "latest API guidance", "WWDC session", "platform availability", "SwiftUI/UIKit/AppKit/Combine/AVFoundation/etc.", or any Apple SDK coding question where authoritative docs are needed. Always use the apple-docs MCP tools for discovery and citations instead of general web search.
