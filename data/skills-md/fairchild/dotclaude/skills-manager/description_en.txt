Use when the user wants to list, search, install, remove, inspect, validate, audit, or update skills. Use when asking "what skills do I have", "is there a skill for X", "check my skills for issues", or "install a skill". Also use when checking skill health across agents (Claude Code, Codex, Agents CLI).
