Use AFTER any code changes (feature implementation, bug fix, refactor) to enforce mandatory dual-pass review. First pass reviews unstaged changes for correctness and convention compliance. Second pass ONLY executes if first pass made any corrections. Ensures work follows project conventions, development rules, and best practices before task completion.
