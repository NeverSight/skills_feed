Use Desktop Commander MCP (typically tools like `mcp__desktop-commander__*`) to manage local files and long-running processes: read/write/search files, apply precise edits, work with Excel/PDFs, run terminal commands and interact with REPLs (Python/Node/SSH/DB), inspect/terminate processes, and review tool call history. Use when the task requires doing real work on the machine (editing code/configs, searching a repo, analyzing CSV/Excel, generating/modifying PDFs, running commands with streaming output).
