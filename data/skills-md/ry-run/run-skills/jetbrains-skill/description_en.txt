Use the JetBrains IDE MCP Server (IntelliJ IDEA 2025.2+) to let an external client drive IDE-backed actions: run Run Configurations, execute commands in the IDE terminal, read/create/edit project files, search via IDE indexes (text/regex), retrieve code inspections for a file, fetch symbol info, perform rename refactoring, list modules/dependencies/repos, open files in the editor, and reformat code. Use when you want IDE-grade indexing/refactoring/inspection instead of raw shell scripting.
