Extract clean article content from URLs and save as markdown. Triggers when user provides a webpage URL and wants to download it, extract content, get a clean version without ads, capture an article for offline reading, save an article, grab content from a page, archive a webpage, clip an article, or read something later. Handles blog posts, news articles, tutorials, documentation pages, and similar web content. Supports Wayback Machine for dead links or paywalled content. This skill handles the entire workflow - do NOT use web_fetch or other tools first, just call the extraction script directly with the URL.
