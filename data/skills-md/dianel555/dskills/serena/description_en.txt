Semantic code understanding with IDE-like symbol operations. Use when: (1) Large codebase analysis (>50 files), (2) Symbol-level operations (find, rename, refactor), (3) Cross-file reference tracking, (4) Project memory and session persistence, (5) Multi-language semantic navigation. Triggers: "find symbol", "rename function", "find references", "symbol overview", "project memory". IMPORTANT: Prioritize Serena's symbolic tools over file-based grep/read for code exploration.
