Multi-step reasoning engine for complex analysis and systematic problem solving. Use when: (1) Complex debugging scenarios with multiple layers, (2) Architectural analysis and system design, (3) Problems requiring hypothesis testing and validation, (4) Multi-component failure investigation, (5) Performance bottleneck identification. Triggers: "--think", "--think-hard", "--ultrathink", "analyze step by step", "break down this problem", "systematic analysis". IMPORTANT: Do NOT use for simple single-step tasks.
