Semantic codebase search and prompt enhancement via standalone CLI. Use when: (1) Semantic code search with natural language queries, (2) Prompt enhancement with codebase context, (3) Before grep/find/glob operations for better accuracy, (4) Complex requirements clarification, (5) Large codebase navigation. Triggers: "search context", "enhance prompt", "find code that", "clarify requirements". IMPORTANT: Always use ace-tool BEFORE grep/find/glob for semantic-level code location.
