Systematic 4-phase debugging: understand the failure, form hypotheses, test one change at a time, fix with confidence. Activate when tests fail unexpectedly, errors occur, behavior is wrong, or something that worked before is now broken. Triggers on: "debug", "why is this failing", "test failure", "unexpected error", "bug", "broken".
