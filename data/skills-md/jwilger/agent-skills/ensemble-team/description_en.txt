Set up a full AI ensemble/mob programming team for any software project. Creates team member profiles (.team/), coordinator instructions (harness-specific config file), project owner constraints (PROJECT.md), team agreements (TEAM_AGREEMENTS.md), domain glossary, and supporting docs. Use when: (1) starting a new project and wanting a full expert agent team, (2) the user asks to "set up a team", "create a mob team", "set up ensemble programming", or "create agent profiles", (3) converting an existing project to the driver-reviewer mob model, (4) the user wants AI agents to work as a coordinated product team with retrospectives and consensus-based decisions.
