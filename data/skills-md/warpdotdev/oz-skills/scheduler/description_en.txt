Schedule on-device reminders and local actions only. Use this skill to set personal reminders or run lightweight, local tasks at a specific time or interval (e.g., notifications, local scripts), on the user's computer or with platforms like Slack. Do NOT use for scheduling cloud agents, background agentic jobs, or Oz-managed workflows.
