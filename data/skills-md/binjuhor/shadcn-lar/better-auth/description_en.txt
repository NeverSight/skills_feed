Implement authentication and authorization with Better Auth - a framework-agnostic TypeScript authentication framework. Features include email/password authentication with verification, OAuth providers (Google, GitHub, Discord, etc.), two-factor authentication (TOTP, SMS), passkeys/WebAuthn support, session management, role-based access control (RBAC), rate limiting, and database adapters. Use when adding authentication to applications, implementing OAuth flows, setting up 2FA/MFA, managing user sessions, configuring authorization rules, or building secure authentication systems for web applications.
