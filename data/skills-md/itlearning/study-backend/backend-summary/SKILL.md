# backend-summary - Backend Learning Notes Generator

Skill for summarizing and saving backend learning notes from the current conversation.

## Instructions

You are a learning notes organizer. Review the current conversation, extract what was learned, and create a well-structured Markdown note.

### Step 0: Language Selection

Ask the user to choose a language at the start using AskUserQuestion:

```
questions:
  - question: "Which language do you prefer? / 어떤 언어로 진행할까요?"
    header: "Language"
    options:
      - label: "한국어"
        description: "한국어로 노트를 작성합니다"
      - label: "English"
        description: "Write notes in English"
    multiSelect: false
```

Use the selected language for the note content and all communication. Code and Kotlin/Spring keywords stay in English.

### Step 1: Analyze Conversation

Scan the current conversation to identify:

- Which topics were covered
- Key concepts explained
- Code examples shown
- Questions asked and answers given
- Areas where the learner struggled or excelled

### Step 2: Confirm Topics

Use AskUserQuestion to confirm what to include:

**Korean:**
```
questions:
  - question: "오늘 학습한 내용을 정리할까요? 포함할 주제를 선택하세요."
    header: "정리할 주제"
    options:
      - label: "전체 정리"
        description: "이 대화에서 학습한 모든 내용을 정리"
      - label: "마지막 주제만"
        description: "가장 최근에 다룬 주제만 정리"
    multiSelect: false
```

**English:**
```
questions:
  - question: "Ready to organize today's notes? Choose what to include."
    header: "Scope"
    options:
      - label: "Everything"
        description: "Summarize all topics from this conversation"
      - label: "Last topic only"
        description: "Only the most recent topic"
    multiSelect: false
```

### Step 3: Generate Note

Create a Markdown note with the structure below.

File path: `study-ios/notes/YYYY-MM-DD-<topic-in-english>.md`

**Note structure:**

```markdown
# <Topic Title>

> Date: YYYY-MM-DD

## Key Concepts

1. **Concept 1**: one-line explanation
2. **Concept 2**: one-line explanation
3. **Concept 3**: one-line explanation

## Diagrams

(Include ASCII diagrams used during the session, if any)

## Code Examples

(Key code examples from the session)

```kotlin
// example code
```

## Summary

(3-5 lines summarizing the core content)

## Review Questions

1. Question 1?
2. Question 2?
3. Question 3?

### Step 4: Save Note

Use the Write tool to save the note to the `study-ios/notes/` directory.

### Step 5: Update Learning Progress

Record learning progress in memory using `mcp__plugin_everything-claude-code-ios_memory__create_entities` or `mcp__plugin_everything-claude-code-ios_memory__add_observations`:

- Entity: "BackendLearningProgress"
- Observations: topic studied, date, level, weak areas

Example:
```
entity: BackendLearningProgress
observations:
  - "2024-01-15: Spring Transaction Management - completed (beginner-intermediate)"
  - "Weak area: propagation types"
```

### Step 6: Wrap Up

After saving, inform the user:

```
Notes saved: notes/YYYY-MM-DD-<topic>.md

Progress recorded.
- Completed: <topic>
- Next suggestion: <next topic>

Continue learning with /backend-study, or review with /backend-quiz.
```

### Rules

1. **Use the selected language** - from Step 0. Only code in English.
2. **Keep it concise** - core ideas only, no long-winded explanations
3. **Review questions required** - at least 3 self-check questions
4. **Progress tracking required** - always save learning history to memory
5. **No emojis** - clean Markdown only
