Programmatic canvas toolkit for creating, editing, and refining Excalidraw diagrams via MCP tools with real-time canvas sync. Use when an agent needs to (1) draw or lay out diagrams on a live canvas, (2) iteratively refine diagrams using describe_scene and get_canvas_screenshot to see its own work, (3) export/import .excalidraw files or PNG/SVG images, (4) save/restore canvas snapshots, (5) convert Mermaid to Excalidraw, or (6) perform element-level CRUD, alignment, distribution, grouping, duplication, and locking. Requires a running canvas server (EXPRESS_SERVER_URL, default http://localhost:3000).
