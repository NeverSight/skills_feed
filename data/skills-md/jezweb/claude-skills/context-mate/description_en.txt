Entry point to the Context Mate toolkit - skills, agents, and slash commands that work with Claude Code's
natural flow. Project lifecycle (/explore-idea → /plan-project → /wrap-session), session handoff
across context windows, developer agents for specialized tasks, and quality auditing.

Use when: starting new projects, understanding the toolkit, needing workflow guidance.
"It's all about the context, maaate!"
