Generate cohesive, project-specific SVG icon sets for websites and applications. Use this skill whenever the user needs custom icons, an icon set for a website or app, icons for a client project, or mentions needing SVG icons that look consistent together. Also trigger when the user describes a project and icons would naturally be part of the deliverable — e.g. "I'm building a site for a plumber" implies they'll need service icons. Trigger on: "icons for", "icon set", "custom icons", "SVG icons", "make me icons", "I need icons", "website icons", "project icons", or any request for consistent visual assets for a web project. This skill produces individual SVG files with a consistent style engine, not generic icon library lookups.
