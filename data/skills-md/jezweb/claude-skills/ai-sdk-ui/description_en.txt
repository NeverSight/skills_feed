Build React chat interfaces with Vercel AI SDK v6. Covers useChat/useCompletion/useObject hooks, message parts structure, tool approval workflows, and 18 UI error solutions. Prevents documented issues with React Strict Mode, concurrent requests, stale closures, and tool approval edge cases.

Use when: implementing AI chat UIs, migrating v5→v6, troubleshooting "useChat failed to parse stream", "stale body values", "React maximum update depth", "Cannot read properties of undefined (reading 'state')", or tool approval workflow errors.
