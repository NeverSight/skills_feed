Scaffold Hono API routes for Cloudflare Workers. Produces route files, middleware, typed bindings, Zod validation, error handling, and API_ENDPOINTS.md documentation. Use after a project is set up with cloudflare-worker-builder or vite-flare-starter, when you need to add API routes, create endpoints, or generate API documentation.
