Evaluate how well a codebase supports autonomous AI development. Analyzes repositories across eight technical pillars (Style & Validation, Build System, Testing, Documentation, Dev Environment, Debugging & Observability, Security, Task Discovery) and five maturity levels. Use when users request `/readiness-report` or want to assess agent readiness, codebase maturity, or identify gaps preventing effective AI-assisted development.
