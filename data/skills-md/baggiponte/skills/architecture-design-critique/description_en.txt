Perform a codebase-wide architectural review through a Ports & Adapters (hexagonal architecture) lens. Assess boundary violations, coupling issues, and dependency direction. Produces a prioritized improvement roadmap. Use when reviewing architecture for testability/portability, assessing technical debt, planning refactoring efforts, or evaluating codebase health. Triggers on requests like "review the architecture", "assess coupling", "hexagonal analysis", "check boundary violations", or "architecture critique".
