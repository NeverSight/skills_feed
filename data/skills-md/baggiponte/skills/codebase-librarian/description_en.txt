Create a comprehensive inventory of a codebase. Map structure, entry points, services, infrastructure, domain models, and data flows. Pure documentation—no opinions or recommendations. Use when onboarding to an unfamiliar codebase, documenting existing architecture before changes, preparing for architecture reviews or migration planning, or creating a reference for the team. Triggers on requests like "map this codebase", "document the architecture", "create an inventory", or "what does this codebase contain".
