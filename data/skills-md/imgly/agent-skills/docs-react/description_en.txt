Look up CE.SDK React reference docs, guides, and configuration pages.

Use when the user needs CE.SDK docs for React — configuration, UI customization,
export options, feature guides, or getting-started instructions. Also triggered by "IMG.LY", "CreativeEditor",
"CE.SDK", or "cesdk" when the user needs an existing React doc page.

Not for writing code (use build) or concept explanations (use explain).

<example>
Context: User asks about React configuration
user: "How do I configure the editor in React?"
assistant: "I'll use /cesdk:docs-react to look up configuration options."
</example>

<example>
Context: User needs React component setup
user: "How do I embed CE.SDK in a React component?"
assistant: "Let me use /cesdk:docs-react to find the relevant documentation."
</example>
