# Ticket — Artifact Creation

All skill output that needs to persist goes into a ticket. No custom directories.

## Tag Taxonomy

Every artifact ticket MUST use the appropriate tags:

| Artifact type | Tags | Example title |
|---|---|---|
| Oracle research | `research, oracle` | "Oracle: Why API latency spiked" |
| Delphi investigation (epic) | `research, delphi` | "Delphi: Database migration strategy" |
| Delphi synthesis | `research, delphi-synthesis` | "Delphi synthesis: Database migration strategy" |
| Implementation plan | `plan` | "Plan: Refactor auth middleware" |
| Architecture decision | `decision` | "ADR: Use Zustand for state management" |
| Postmortem | `postmortem` | "Postmortem: Agent skipped codebase exploration" |
| Code review | `review` | "Review: PR #42 auth changes" |
| Design spec | `design-spec` | "Design spec: Dashboard redesign" |

## Creating Artifact Tickets

Use `tk` (via `todos_oneshot` or `todos` tool):

```
todos_oneshot(
  title: "Oracle: <topic>",
  description: "<full findings>",
  tags: "research,oracle",
  type: "task"
)
```

### Epics with Subtasks

For multi-part artifacts (e.g. Delphi = N oracles + synthesis):

1. Create the **epic** ticket first
2. Create **subtask** tickets linked to it
3. Use `teams delegate` to run subtasks in parallel
4. Update the epic with synthesized results

```
# 1. Epic
todos_oneshot(title: "Delphi: <topic>", tags: "research,delphi", type: "epic")

# 2. Subtasks (one per oracle)
todos_oneshot(title: "Oracle 1: <topic>", tags: "research,oracle", type: "task")
todos_oneshot(title: "Oracle 2: <topic>", tags: "research,oracle", type: "task")
todos_oneshot(title: "Oracle 3: <topic>", tags: "research,oracle", type: "task")

# 3. teams delegate to run in parallel
# 4. Synthesize into epic
```

## Rules

1. **No custom output directories.** No `.oracle/`, `.plans/`, `.design-specs/`, `docs/postmortems/`, `docs/research/`.
2. **Tags are mandatory.** Every artifact ticket uses tags from the taxonomy above.
3. **Titles are descriptive.** Prefix with artifact type (Oracle:, Plan:, ADR:, etc.).
4. **Full content in the ticket.** The ticket body IS the artifact — not a pointer to a file elsewhere.
5. **Link related tickets.** Subtasks link to epics. Plans link to implementation tickets. Postmortems link to the incident tickets.
