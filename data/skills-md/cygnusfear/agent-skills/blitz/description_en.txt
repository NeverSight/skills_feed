This skill should be used when parallelizing multi-issue sprints using git worktrees and parallel agents. Use when tackling multiple GitHub issues simultaneously, when the user mentions "blitz", "parallel sprint", "worktree workflow", or when handling 3+ independent issues that could be worked on concurrently. Orchestrates the full workflow from issue triage through parallel agent delegation to sequential merge.
