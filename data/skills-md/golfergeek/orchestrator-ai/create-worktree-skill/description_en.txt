Use when the user explicitly asks for a SKILL to create a worktree. If the user does not mention "skill" or explicitly request skill invocation, do NOT trigger this. Only use when user says things like "use a skill to create a worktree" or "invoke the worktree skill". Creates isolated git worktrees with parallel-running configuration.
